This worksheet will help you work through some examples of different data classes and how we can use them. 

You can write code into the code boxes and click the "Run Code" box to interact or answer the prompts. Some boxes may have *hints*, click the box to find out more!

## Dataframes

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```
