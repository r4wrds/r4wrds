Welcome! There’s a few things we’d like everyone to try and do <font color="#0072B2">*before*</font> the workshop starts. For this workshop and the following lessons, we need to install the following programs/software in this order (more details below for different operating systems):

<aside>
Our goal is for you to learn how to use these tools so you can get stuff done. You can learn to be an expert later! These are guidelines to install the necessary tools. Feel free to let us know if you run into trouble!

 5. Download Data for the Workshop

Below, we provide extra details appropriate for Windows and MacOSX operating systems. For additional installation options, see [here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#install-r-and-rstudio).

## Step 1. Install &nbsp;[<img src="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" alt="R" width="7%">&nbsp;](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

R is the underlying statistical computing environment, or the engine we use to do things. 

### *Windows*: Download and install R
Go to [CRAN and download](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version. Download the <font color="#0072B2">`.exe`</font> file and double click to install.

 - You can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination
screen, please verify that R is installing `C:\Program Files\R` (*version number may vary*), and **you may need administrative privileges to do this if you're not working on your personal computer.**

At the "Select Components" screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

![](images/install_arch_window.png#inline-img "select architecture")

At this screen, uncheck "Create a desktop icon" because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.

![](images/install_tasks.png#inline-img "uncheck desktop icon")

### *MacOS*: Download and install R

 - Download and install R from the CRAN website [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
 - Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
 - Double click on the downloaded file to install R and follow the setup steps 
 - Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) if you don't already have it (some packages require it)


## Step 2. Install &nbsp;[<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg" alt="RStudio Desktop" width="14%">&nbsp;](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Using R alone is possible, but less ideal (and less fun!). RStudio is an open-source graphical **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment or **IDE** that makes using R much easier and more interactive. In this course, we will use the *free RStudio Desktop version*.

### *Windows*: Download and install RStudio Desktop (free)

 - Download and install from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
 - Select **RStudio x.yy.zz - Windows Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, z are version numbers)
 - Double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install, so you may need IT assistance if using a work computer.
 - Accept all the default options for the RStudio install

### *macOS*: Download and install RStudio Desktop (free)

 - Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) download page
 - Under Installers select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
 - Double click the file to install RStudio
 - Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.


### Check Install!

Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu.  Start up RStudio.

 - **Find "Console" window**: By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio.  Find that window.  It will looking something like:

![](images/rstudio_console.png#inline-img "RStudio console")

 - **Copy and paste the following code:** Once in that console window, copy the code below and paste it into the Console window (just to the right of the little **`>`**). Then hit `ENTER`.

    ```r
    version$version.string
    ```

 - **Verify your installed R version**: Ideally you should be running the latest stable release. If you have an older version, please install the newest version using the instructions above.

 - Here is what a current R version looks like.
 
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
    version$version.string
    ```

## Step 3. Install R Packages

The core set of packages we will need are as follows. There may be a few more we need to install during the course, but this should be the majority.

We install packages available for all R users from an online repository called  [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), by pasting the following code into the **RStudio Console window** and hitting `ENTER`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("lubridate")

```

You may see a message

```r
There are binary versions available but the source versions are later:
```
followed by a list of the packages you are trying to install. This is usually followed by this message: 

```r
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
``` 

Compilation means the code associated with the package needs to be translated into R and built for your operating system. Generally we can use the binary option, so after that message type "**No**" and hit "**Enter**" on the keyboard. In some cases we do need/want to compile the package to get the most recent updates. *For this course, try installing from binary (type **No**) first*!

You may see this: 

![](images/personal_library_dialog.png#inline-img "dialog box behind")

That's OK! There’s a dialog box hiding behind RStudio asking if you want to create a personal folder in your Documents folder.  Click *Yes*. It will look something like this when done:

![](images/general_pkg_output.png#inline-img "console output")


## Step 4. Install Geospatial Packages

For some of the mapping and spatial lessons, we need a set of geospatial tools/packages. For the majority of the content we will cover, this requires installation of the [{`sf`}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package. When we run the lines below, we may get a question in the Console that is preceded by a list of package names and columns with `binary`, `source`, and `needs_compilation`. That's ok! 

The **First Option** should be to try and install *without* compilation. So, if you run the lines below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("sf")
install.packages("mapview")

```

And you see a message similar to below (yours will probably look different!!):
```
 There are binary versions available but the source versions are later:
          binary source needs_compilation
sf         1.0-6  1.0-7             FALSE
mapview   2.10.3 2.11.0              TRUE

Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel) 
```

Just make sure to type "**No**" at the end of the line and hit `Enter`!

---
### Installing from Source (with Compilation)

**However, more commonly, we may need to install/update from source to have the most updated functions and options from a package** (*don't worry if you have no idea what this all means yet!*). This generally means the code needs to be translated and built or compiled so your computer can interpret it. To do so, we need to follow instructions below for the operating system of your choice.

### `Windows` Geospatial Instructions (from source):

To install {`sf`} successfully from source, Windows users will need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Download the 64-bit compiler.

After installing [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), one final step remains...adding RTools to your path. This may require administrative privileges.

**_Why do we need to do this?_**

What does this mean? Why do we need to do it? RTools is like a translator for your computer, and it helps translate code and build software (R packages). Before your computer can use it, we need to tell R (on your computer) where the RTools you just installed is actually located. Once we add this path (the location of the directory where RTools lives), the computer can use it when it is needed.

**_To Add RTools to your Path_**

Good news is we can typically do this within R/RStudio without too much trouble. Try this:

 1. Open RStudio
 2. Navigate to the **Console** panel
 3. Right after the `>` prompt, paste the following line and hit `Enter` or `Return`
    
      `writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")` 

 4. Test that it worked. Close down RStudio, reopen it, and in the **Console** after the `>` prompt, paste the following: 

      `Sys.which("make")`

 5. We should see something like this printed out:

      `# "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"`

Now you should be able to install or "*compile*" packages in R in Windows. Proceed with installation instructions for additional packages! 

### `MacOS` Geospatial Instructions (from source): 

For MacOS users, follow the recommended instructions on the [{`sf`}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) webpage, which if possible, requires opening a Terminal window and successfully installing [Homebrew with the code at this website](https://brew.sh/). You can test if `brew` is installed by typing `brew config` in the Terminal and hitting **Enter**.

We can then install a few spatial tools (via Terminal still!) with the following code:

```
brew install pkg-config
# then hit enter and wait

brew install gdal
# then hit enter and wait

```

At this point, you should now be able to install {`sf`} from binary on a Mac. Proceed to the next section!

### Install Spatial R Packages

After this has successfully installed, return to the RStudio "Console", and install the following packages by typing the following into the console and pressing "return" on the keyboard:

```{r spatialPkgs, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("sf")
install.packages("mapview")
```

For {`sf`}, try installing from binary first (so type "**No**" in your `R Console` window and hit **Enter**).

Success should return something like this (not an error message) when you load the library with `library(sf)`:

```r
library(sf)
# Linking to GEOS 3.9.1, GDAL 3.2.3, PROJ 7.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE
```

<aside>
Additional geospatial installation instructions can be found [here](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html), but try the listed approach first.
</aside>

As a final sanity check, copy/paste the following in the console in RStudio and press `Enter`. This will open an interactive map of the built-in dataset `breweries` in the "Viewer" pane, and will look like the map below. Click on points and pan around to celebrate a successful install!

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview(breweries)
```


## Step 5. Download Workshop Datasets

We'll be working with a few different datasets for this workshop (see [here](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data-intro)). We've zipped all these files into a single folder, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data-intro/raw/main/data.zip). Bear in mind this **`.zip`** file is ~30 MB in size, and may take a few minutes to download depending on internet connections.

 - [**Download the zipped file of all intro course data**](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data-intro/raw/main/data.zip).
 - We will help you set up a project and put the data in the correct place.

### Quick Test!

Just to make sure each package installed successfully, do the following:

1. Open up RStudio
2. Find the "Console."  This is usually the bottom left pane in RStudio
3. In the "Console", find the R Prompt (the part that starts with `>`)
4. Type in (or copy and paste from here will also work) the following command at the R Prompt and hit return  

```{r checkPkg}

# check that these packages are installed successfully:
c("tidyverse", "sf", "viridis", "mapview") %in% installed.packages()

```

If you have successfully installed packages, you should see a list of "`TRUE`" repeated once for each package listed inside the `c( )`.
