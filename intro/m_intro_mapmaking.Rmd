## Geospatial data with {sf}

R is a powerful tool for working with spatial data and making maps. Within R, you can do nearly everything that a GUI type program can do (e.g., ArcGIS or QGIS), and moreover, you can write a script to automate or scale up routine analyses, thus saving time on repetitive tasks and ensuring you create reproducible workflows.  

There are a variety of spatial mapping/plotting packages in R. However, the best option being used widely for vector-based spatial data in R is the **`{sf}`** package. **`{sf}`** is a powerful, clean, and fairly straightforward approach because it has an easy to use syntax, it is fast and it can do most if not all of the tasks commonly done in other geospatial software programs. Even better, **`{sf}`** spatial objects are simply data.frames with a `geometry` column, so all of the tidy, wrangle, join, and plot capabilities from {dplyr} and {ggplot2} also work on **`{sf}`** objects. Therefore, it is possible to use R to address all your data processing needs in a single environment without the need to move between tools for tabular data (e.g., Excel) and geospatial data (e.g., ArcGIS or QGIS).  

<aside>
`sf` stands for "simple features" which is a way of representing spatial data. See the R [**`{sf}`** package documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for more details. "*Sticky geometry*" in the figure means that all geometry information is contained in a single column, and that column follows the data, no matter how you work with it.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap='(ref:ah-sf)'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf.png")
```

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(sf)

# subset stations down to sac county and save
stations <- read_csv("data/gwl/stations.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"), crs = 4269, remove = FALSE)

# read Sacramento county shapefile and transform to NAD83, EPSG 4269
sac <- st_read("data/shp/sac/sac_county.shp", quiet = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(4269)

# crops stations to sac county, add lat and lon, and 
st_intersection(stations, sac) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  write_csv("data/gwl/stations_sac.csv")
```


### Reading spatial data

The **`{sf}`** package can read spatial data in various formats (e.g., shapefile, GeoJSON, PostGIS, kml), and is very straightforward if the data is already spatial, requiring only a call to the function `st_read()`.


```{r st-read}
# First we load the sf and here packages
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)

# may need to unzip first:
unzip("data/shp/sac_county.zip", exdir = "data/shp/sac")

# Read a shapefile of Sacramento county 
sac <- st_read("data/shp/sac/sac_county.shp", quiet = TRUE) 

colnames(sac)
```

<aside> Note, the `quiet = TRUE` option suppresses printing information about the imported spatial data. Sometimes this information is helpful, but see `read_sf()` which is the same as `st_read()` but defaults to *quietly* reading in data.
</aside>

### Converting a dataframe to sf

At other times, you may need to convert tabular data to a spatial format. To make an **`{sf}`** object, we are creating a `geometry` column. This contains all the geospatial information we need, and it lives within the dataframe. Importantly, this geometry column is "sticky", meaning whatever we do to our data (tidy, filter, mutate etc) the associated `geometry` column will stick with the data. What's awesome is this column can contain anything from information for a point to a line to a complex polygon -- all in one column. *To make an {sf} object, we need to know two important pieces of information...*

 - **`coords`**: The columns that contain the geospatial coordinates (either name or column number)  
 - **`crs`**: The [projection](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/) or [EPSG (CRS, SRID, etc)](http://epsg.io/) that the data in^[Coordinate reference systems are an entire lesson unto themselves. For a good overview, check out this [Data Carpentry lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/index.html). ]
 
To practice, let's read all groundwater level monitoring stations in Sacramento County, `stations_sac.csv`, and convert this tabular data to an `sf` object with the function `st_as_sf()`. We will specify which columns contain the coordinates (**`coords`**), and what the projection, or coordinate reference system (**`crs`**) the data is in. In this case, we know the data is in NAD83, or EPSG 4269.  

<aside>
Notice that all functions in **`{sf}`** begin with an "`st_`" prefix. This makes it easy to type "st_" and use tab-completion to find `{sf}` functions, and it also makes it easier to read code and spot spatial transformations.  
</aside>

```{r st-as-sf}

# read groundwater level stations in Sacramento county as dataframe
stations <- read_csv("data/gwl/stations_sac.csv")

# check object class
class(stations)

# convert stations into an sf object by specifying coordinates and crs
stations <- st_as_sf(stations, 
                     coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"), # note x goes first
                     crs = 4269, # projection, this is NAD83
                     remove = FALSE) # don't remove lat/lon cols from dataframe

# check the class of the new object
class(stations)
```

### Projecting spatial data

A common problem in geospatial analysis is when two different datasets are in different projections. We can check the projection of our `sac` and `stations` objects with the function `st_crs()`, and transform our data (or re-project) with the `st_transform()` function.  

We know `stations` is in NAD83, but what about `sac`? Let's check with `st_crs()`. Line 2 of the output indicates WGS84.    

```{r st-crs}
st_crs(sac)
```

We can re-project, or transform the projection (crs) with `st_transform()` and by specifying the EPSG code to transform the data to. Here we use [NAD83 (EPSG: 4269)](https://epsg.io/4269), so the Sacramento county boundary (`sac`) is in the same projection as the groundwater level monitoring points (`stations`).

```{r st-crs2}
sac <- st_transform(sac, crs = 4269)
```

Lastly, we verify our transformation worked. 

```{r st-crs3}
st_crs(sac)
```

We can even ask R if the projection (crs) of `sac` and `stations` are identical, and they are.

```{r st-crs4}
identical(st_crs(stations), st_crs(sac))
```

We can also transform data using the actual sf object or dataframe, without needing to find the specific EPSG or CRS code. For example, if we want to transform our **`sac`** county polygon into the same projection as our **`stations`** data, we can do the following:

```{r st-crs5}

sac <- st_transform(sac, crs = st_crs(stations))

# verify these are the same
identical(st_crs(stations), st_crs(sac))

# or look at just the EPSG code:
st_crs(sac)$epsg
st_crs(stations)$epsg

```


### Spatial join with st_intersection()

With all of our spatial data in the same projection, we can perform a spatial join. Perhaps the most common spatial join is an intersection. For example, above, the `stations` object only contains stations in Sacramento County, but it came from a much larger set of stations (n = 43,807). Let's bring in all groundwater stations in the state of California, convert it to an `sf` object class, and plot the data. 

```{r st-intersection}

# all gw stations in California
all_gw_stations <- read_csv("data/gwl/stations.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"), 
           crs = 4269, 
           remove = FALSE) 

```

```{r plot-all-stations, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

# plot, and make the points opaque and small
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = all_gw_stations, cex = 0.05, alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_void()

```


As we can see above, groundwater monitoring stations are concentrated in Bulletin 118 subbasins.^[Bulletin 118 subbasins are DWR desginated zones that generally correspond to productive aquifers, and can be [viewed here](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/b5325164abf94d5cbeb48bb542fa616e_0?geometry=-158.535%2C31.067%2C-80.049%2C43.273).]

Using `dplyr::filter()` we can subset these stations to Sacramento County.


```{r st-intersection2, out.width"100%"}

# filter to Sacramento county & verify this worked
stations_sac <- stations %>% 
  filter(COUNTY_NAME == "Sacramento") 

# verify this worked
unique(stations_sac$COUNTY_NAME)

```


But what if we didn't have the county data already, or if we wanted to filter these data by a polygon that wasn't detailed in one of the existing variables in our dataframe? In this case, we can use `st_intersection()` which is a **spatial join** that takes two arguments, the `sf` object we want to filter (`x`), and another `sf` object to filter by (`y`). If we use `x = all_gw_stations` and `y = sac` it will return all of the points in `all_gw_stations` that fall within `sac` county.

Before performing the spatial join, we must re-project our data from a **geographic** coordinate reference system (CRS) to a **projected** coordinate reference system.^[A discussion on coordinate reference systems is a complex topic in and of itself, and for the purposes of this module, we summarize it as follows: A geographic CRS is **round** and based on *angular units* of degrees (lat/lng), whereas a projected CRS is **flat** and has *linear* units (meters or feet). Many functions in `{sf}` that make calculations on data expect a projected CRS, and can return inaccurate results if an object in a geographic CRS is used. This is a fascinating topic with lots written about it! For more reading see this [Esri blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/), the Data Carpentry [geospatial lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/), and the [online Geocomputation with R book](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/reproj-geo-data.html).]

```{r st-intersection3, out.width"100%"}

# it's good practice to ensure your spatial data are in a projected CRS
# like meters before performing spatial operations, so we transform to 3310
all_gw_stations_3310 <- st_transform(stations, 3310)
sac_3310 <- st_transform(sac, 3310)

# perform the intersection 
stations_sac_3310 <- st_intersection(all_gw_stations_3310, sac_3310) 

# number of observations in each county
table(stations_sac_3310$COUNTY_NAME)
```

<aside> EPSG 3310 is UTM NAD83, which is a metric grid with *meters* as the unit of measurement. It's typically more accurate and easier to use for geospatial operations and measurements compared to *degrees* (latitude/longitude).
</aside>

Interestingly, there are 4 counties in our data after the spatial join. Why is that? If we visualize the data, we can see that all of these points are right on the border of Sacramento County, and the process that previously added county names to these data must have used a slightly different Sacramento county polygon than the one we are using in this module. 

```{r plot-sac-stations, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac_3310) +
  geom_sf(data = stations_sac_3310, aes(color = COUNTY_NAME)) +
  theme_void()

```

There are many many more methods available beyond intersections, including area, distances, buffers, crops, voronoi polygons, nearest neighbor calculations, convex hull calculations, centroid calculations, and much, much more. The list of operations within `{sf}` are shown below.  

```{r sf-methods}
methods(class = 'sfc')
```

To learn more about advanced spatial operations, see the [Spatial data module in the Intermediate to Advanced wrds course](), and [online books and resources](#additional-resources).  



## Plotting {sf} data

With all of our spatial data in the same projection, we can start making maps! We will cover the built-in `plot()` method for `{sf}` objects, interactive maps with `{mapview}`, and plotting with `{ggplot2}`.  

### Inspect data with `plot()`

After reading spatial data you may want to plot it to make sure that it imported correctly, and to understand the fields. For a quick plot, you can simply use `plot()`. 

```{r sf-plot, out.width="100%"}

# plot the geometry
plot(sac$geometry)
```

If we don't specify the "geometry" column, `plot()` will plot the first 10 columns in the dataframe (you can control the number of subplots shown with the `max.plot` argument). Here we can see there are 4 distinct basins (BASIN_CODE) in Sacramento County. 

```{r sf-plot2, out.width="100%"}
plot(stations)
```


## Interactive mapping with {mapview}

One of the easiest and coolest packages you'll find for interactive mapping is **`{mapview}`**. As long as data are in `sf` format, you can quickly make an interactive map. First let's make sure we have an `sf` class of data.

```{r sf-class}
class(stations)
class(sac)
```

### Basic use

Next we can use the simple `mapview()` function to create an interactive webmap!

```{r mapview1, out.width="100%"}
library(mapview)

mapview(sac)

```

We can add `{mapview}` objects to one another in the same way we add layers to a `ggplot`, by using a **`+`**. We can then toggle them on and off from the interactive map from the top-left hand layer control icon. We can also change the basemap layers being used on the map from this same menu.

```{r mapview2, out.width="100%"}
# combine sac and stations data
mapview(sac) + mapview(stations) 
```

Note that we can open a `{mapview}` object in our default web browser by clicking on the little box and arrow to expand and view. This is particularly helpful when pop-up tables contain dense information, as is the case with our `stations` dataframe.

```{r mapview-expand, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mapview_expand.png")
```

### Customizing mapview

Not only can you combine mapview objects, but you can also customize their appearance by adjusting a variety of built-in arguments to the `mapview()` function. 

```{r mapview3, out.width="100%"}
# make sac polygon transparent, with a thick red outline
mapview(sac, alpha.regions = 0, color = "red", lwd = 2, layer.name = "Sac Co") +
  # color points by the well depth
  mapview(stations, zcol = "WELL_DEPTH", layer.name = "Well depth (ft)") 
```


:::challenge

<font color="#009E73">**Challenge 1: You Try!**</font> 

1. Create a new mapview object of Sacramento County (`sac`), plus `stations` colored by "WELL_USE". Add the argument `burst = TRUE`, and read the mapview documentation to learn what this does (Hint: Enter `?mapview` and scroll to "Arguments").  
2. Toggle all layers off except for irrigation and residential wells. Recall this relationship for the next module on EDA.

`{mapview}` is a great package for quickly visualizing and sharing spatial data. To export and save a .html map that can be shared with others, it's currently advisable to specify `mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)` after loading the library. This allows us to save the map as a self-contained html file. To do so, click on the **Viewer** tab, and then on **_Export_** > **_Save as Web Page_**. This `.html` file can then be zipped and emailed or shared, and opened in most web browsers.

## Static maps with {ggplot2}

Interactive maps are useful for fast data exploration and integration into web applications, however, depending on the project, static maps may more appropriate for reports, presentations, and sharing. Mapmaking with `{sf}` objects in `{ggplot2}` follows the same syntax we practiced in the [ggplot2 module](04_ggplot.html#adding-geom_-layers), using the `geom_sf()` function. 

### Basic use

```{r geomsf, out.width="100%", message = FALSE}
# put data in geoms rather than ggplot() as we have multiple datasets in one plot
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) 
```

Adding a north arrow and scale bar is achieved with the `{ggspatial}` package.

```{r geomsf2, out.width="100%", message = FALSE}
p + 
  # north arrow (top left) & scale bar (bottom right) 
  ggspatial::annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl") +
  ggspatial::annotation_scale(location = "br") +
  labs(x = "Longitude (NAD83)", y = "Latitude", 
       title = "Groundwater monitoring staions",
       subtitle = "Sacramento County") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Just as before in {ggplot2}, we can connect an aesthetic, `aes`, like `color` to one of the column variables. We can also facet and change the `theme()`. For maps, `theme_void()` is useful because it removes graticules (grid lines), axis ticks, and labels which allows us to focus on the data explored in the plot.

```{r geomsf3, out.width="100%", message = FALSE}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations, aes(color = WELL_DEPTH)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c("Well depth (ft)") + 
  theme_void() 
p
```

:::challenge

<font color="#009E73">**Challenge 2: Debug and modify.**</font> 

Fix the following code that, as written, will return an error. Then, with the fixed code, map the color aesthetic to how the well is used (`WELL_USE`), and add a viridis color scale to this *discrete* variable.
```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() %>% 
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations) 
```


:::

<br>

<details>
  <summary class="challenge-ans-title"><font color="#0072B2">**Click for Answers!**</font></summary>
  <div class="challenge-ans-body">


```{r challenge-2a, eval = FALSE}
# Use `+` instead of `%>%` to add ggplot objects together
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations) 
```

Map "`WELL_USE`" to color in the stations dataframe, and ensure the color scale is a discrete variable with: scale_color_viridis_**d**()

```{r challenge-2b}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations, aes(color = WELL_USE)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d("Well type", option = "B") +
  theme_void()
```

  </div>
</details>



### Customizing maps in ggplot2

Because we're working in {ggplot2}, we can also `facet_wrap()` and customize the `theme()`.

```{r geomsf4, out.width="100%", message = FALSE}
# facet the plot we created above, p, by the well use
p +
  facet_wrap(~WELL_USE, nrow = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(barwidth = unit(20, "lines"), 
                                barheight = unit(0.5, "lines"),
                                title.hjust = 0.5, 
                                title.position = "top"))
```

We might notice that a few extremely deep wells dominate the color scale and cause it to extend to large values that prevent us from seeing variation in shallower well depths. We can improve this visualization by drawing on some skills from the [dplyr module](m_dplyr.html#mutate-existing-data). Let's overwrite large well depth values with `dplyr::mutate()` and improve our labeling on the map.

```{r geomsf5, out.width="100%", message = FALSE, preview = TRUE}
# only 4.7% of wells have a well depth that exceeds 700 feet
# but the color bar goes all the way to 1600 feet!
sum(stations$WELL_DEPTH >= 700, na.rm = TRUE) / nrow(stations)

# overwrite large values & assign the resulting dataframe to a new object
stations_viz <- stations %>% 
  mutate(WELL_DEPTH = ifelse(WELL_DEPTH >= 700, 700, WELL_DEPTH))

# replot with the new stations_viz object
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sac) +
  geom_sf(data = stations_viz, aes(color = WELL_DEPTH)) +
  facet_wrap(~WELL_USE, nrow = 2) + 
  # improve labels to reflect the changes made to values in these data
  scale_color_viridis_c("Well depth (ft)",
                        # break points for labels along the colorbar
                        breaks = seq(0, 700, 100),
                        # labels to insert at each of the breaks
                        labels = c(seq(0, 600, 100), "> 700")) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(barwidth = unit(20, "lines"), 
                                barheight = unit(0.5, "lines"),
                                title.hjust = 0.5, 
                                title.position = "top"))
p
```

In this improved visualization, it's clear that irrigation wells tend to be deeper than residential wells. The main cluster of "Other" wells is associated with the [Aerojet Superfund site](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-epa-issues-order-aerojet-general-corporation-superfund-site), and are fairly deep, around 300-600 ft.


### Exporting maps in ggplot2

Once a map has been created, how do we get it out of R and into a form we can share with others? One option is to save a map directly from the Plot viewer in RStudio.

```{r save-map, out.width="80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/export_sf_map.png")
```

For more control and reproducibility, we can also save a map by using the methods covered in the ["Saving plots" section of data visualization module](04_ggplot.html#saving-plots), which include `ggsave()`. It's good to practice this way of doing things because it will build your understanding and help you automate saving hundreds of plots at a single time down the road.  

```{r save-map2}
ggsave("results/sac_well_depth_type.png", p, height = 5, width = 8)
```


## Additional Resources

We covered 3 common frameworks in which to plot spatial data in R: the `plot()` method for `{sf}` objects, `{mapview}` package, and `{ggplot2}`. Although these are popular and powerful approaches to visualize and map spatial data, other packages in the R ecosystem are available including:  

* [`{leaflet}`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and extensions like [`{leafpop}`](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafpop)  
* [`{tmap}`](https://mtennekes.github.io/tmap/)  
* [`{mapdeck}`](https://symbolixau.github.io/mapdeck/articles/mapdeck.html)  
* [`{rasterVis}`](https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/) for raster data  
* [`{plotly}`](https://plotly-r.com/maps.html)  

The online books/guides [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), [*RSpatial.org*](https://rspatial.org/), and [*Spatial Data Science*](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/) are additional resources for a deeper dive into spatial data processing and mapping in R.
