## Who is this course for?

This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who work with data, from analysts and program staff to engineers and scientists. This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (`R`) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of `R`.

<br> 

## Why `R`?

[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization. 

This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of `R`. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, and provide resources for additional learning.

<br>

## What will you learn?

In this course, we start from first principles and assume no prior experience with `R`. Although each module in this course can serve as a "stand-alone" lesson, we recommend completing modules in order from start to finish.

**In this course you will gain practice in: **

 - Data and file management: understanding RProjects and file paths
 - Understand and identifying different data formats (i.e., wide, long, tidy)
 - Working with different data structures (i.e., vectors, dataframes, lists) 
 - Importing and exporting various water resources data
 - Strategies for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Strategies for troubleshooting (reading documentation, intro to reprex)
 - Transforming data with `{dplyr}`
 - Data visualization with `{ggplot2}`
 - Data presentation and communication with RMarkdown

## Data

All data used in this course is expected to live in a `/data` subfolder in the project directory. It can be downloaded in 1 of 2 ways:

1. [Downloaded and unzipped from OSF](https://osf.io/d7qse/download)  
2. [Cloned from the `wrds-data` Github repository](https://github.com/richpauloo/r4wrds-data)  

Your project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the `/data` subfolder):

```
.
├── code
│   ├── module_01.R
│   └── module_02.R
│   └── ...
├── data
│   ├── gwl.csv
│   └── polygon.shp
│   └── ...
└── intro.Rproj
```

To complete code exercises and follow along in the course, you will create a `/code` subfolder to store `.R` scripts, which we recommend naming by module. 

You will also need to create an `intro.Rproj` file, covered in the [introductory project management module](m_project_management.html#use-project-workflows). Alternatively, on the command line, use `touch intro.Rproj` (MacOS/Linux) or `echo > intro.Rproj` (Windows) in the root project directory.

<br>


## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.
