This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (`R`) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of `R`.\n\n<br> \n\n## Why `R`?\n\n[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization. \n\nThis workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of `R`. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, and provide resources for additional learning.\n\n<br>\n\n## What will you learn?\n\nIn this course, we start from first principles and assume no prior experience with `R`. Although each module in this course can serve as a \"stand-alone\" lesson, we recommend completing modules in order from start to finish.\n\n**In this course you will gain practice in: **\n\n - Data and file management: understanding RProjects and file paths\n - Understand and identifying different data formats (i.e., wide, long, tidy)\n - Working with different data structures (i.e., vectors, dataframes, lists) \n - Importing and exporting various water resources data\n - Strategies for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n - Strategies for troubleshooting (reading documentation, intro to reprex)\n - Transforming data with `dplyr`\n - Data visualization with `ggplot2`\n - Data presentation and communication with RMarkdown\n\n\n(ref:AHRemoteR) *Artwork by @allison_horst*\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:AHRemoteR)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/monster_support.jpg){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::obj\n\n**Course Modules**\n\n1. [Install R and RStudio](m_install_R.qmd)  \n2. [Get oriented in RStudio](m_getting_started.qmd)  \n3. [Practice data and file management: understand RProjects and file paths](m_project_management.qmd) \n4. [Import and export various water resources data](m_importing_and_exporting_data.qmd)   \n5. [Visualize data with `ggplot2`](m_ggplot.qmd)   \n6. [Understand and identify different data structures (i.e., vectors, dataframes, lists)](m_data_structures.qmd)    \n7. [Transform data with `dplyr`](m_dplyr.qmd)    \n8. [Discuss spreadsheets and pivots](m_pivots.qmd)    \n9. [Learn how to write custom functions](m_functions.qmd)  \n10.

[Explore strategies for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](m_exploratory_DA.qmd)  \n13. [Practice data presentation and communication with `RMarkdown`](m_intro_Rmarkdown.qmd)  \n14. [Explore strategies for troubleshooting (reading documentation, intro to reprex)](m_troubleshooting.qmd)  \n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n## Data\n\nAll data used in this course is expected to live in a `/data` subfolder in the project directory. It can be downloaded in 1 of 2 ways:\n\n1. [Download combined Rproj and dataset from the `r4wrds-data` Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/raw/main/r4wds_proj.zip)\n2. [Download data-only from OSF](https://osf.io/d7qse/download)  \n\nYour project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the `/data` subfolder):\n\n```\n.\n├── scripts\n│   ├── module_01.R\n│   └── module_02.R\n│   └── ...\n├── data\n│   ├── gwl.csv\n│   └── polygon.shp\n│   └── ...\n└── intro_proj.Rproj\n```\n\nTo complete code exercises and follow along in the course, we will create these folders and download the data in the [introductory project management module](m_project_management.qmd#use-project-workflows). \n\n<br>\n\n\n## Workshop Overview\n\nWe will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Source content\n\nAll source materials for this website can be accessed at the [`r4wrds` Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds).  \n\n<br>\n\n\n## Attribution\n\nContent in these lessons has been modified and/or adapted from [Data Carpentry: `R` for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.qmd), the USGS-R training curriculum [here](https://github.com/USGS-R/training-curriculum), the NCEAS Open Science for Synthesis workshop [here](https://nceas.github.io/oss-2017/index.qmd), [Mapping in `R`](https://ryanpeek.org/mapping-in-R-workshop/), and the wonderful text [`R` for data science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).\n\n\n<br> \n\n\n---\n\n*site last updated: ``2025-12-16 08:45``*\n",
