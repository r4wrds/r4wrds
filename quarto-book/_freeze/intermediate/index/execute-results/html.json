This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who:\n\n-   Took the [Introductory R4WRDS](../intro/index.qmd) course\n-   Regularly use `R` and want improve their efficiency and skill set\n-   Have a general understanding and proficiency in using `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `sf`, and `rmarkdown`\n-   Understand (and use) general best practices for data science in `R`\n\n<br>\n\n## Why `R`?\n\n[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization.\n\n<br>\n\n## What will you learn?\n\nIn this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic `R` skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a \"stand-alone\" lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn't necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\n\n**This course emphasizes:**\n\n-   Intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency\n-   Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data\n-   The fundamentals of building Shiny Apps\n-   Pulling water resources data from APIs\n-   Intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing\n-   Integrating version control in projects with git\n\n(ref:AHRemoteR) *Artwork by @allison_horst*\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:AHRemoteR)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/monster_support.jpg){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: obj\n**Course Modules**\n\n1.

If you've already downloaded [**zipped data and Rproj file**](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/raw/main/r4wds_proj.zip) from the introductory course setup, you're already set and can move on to the modules. \n\n### Create a New Project\n\nIf you want to set up your own new RStudio project (*highly recommend for experience!*), we can create a new project file (`intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj`), in a few different ways. Directly from RStudio (detailed in the [introductory project management module](../intro/m_project_management.qmd#use-project-workflows)), or via the command line. We can use `touch intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj` (MacOS/Linux) or `echo > intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj` (Windows) in the root project directory.\n\nTo complete code exercises and follow along in the course, you will create a `/data` subfolder, and a `/scripts` subfolder to store `.R` scripts, which we recommend naming by module.\n\nYour project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the `/data` subfolder):\n\n    .\n    ├── scripts\n    │   ├── module_01.R\n    │   └── module_02.R\n    │   └── ...\n    ├── data\n    │   ├── gwl.csv\n    │   └── polygon.shp\n    │   └── ...\n    └── intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj\n\n### Download Data\n\nOnce an RStudio project has been created we can download the data in in a few ways:\n\n1.  Download to a data folder in your project from a [Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    # downloads the data.zip file to the `data` directory\n    dir.create(\"data\")\n    download.file(\"https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/raw/main/data.zip\", destfile = \"data/data.zip\")\n\n    # unzip the data:\n    unzip(zipfile = \"data/data.zip\")\n\n    # if get resulting __MACOSX folder (artifact of unzip), remove:\n    unlink(\"__MACOSX\", recursive = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2.  [Downloaded and unzipped from OSF](https://osf.io/qweju/download)\n\nOnce data have been downloaded and moved to a data folder, or downloaded directly into the project, we are ready to roll!\n\n<br>\n\n## Workshop Overview\n\nWe will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.\n\n<br>\n\n## Source content\n\nAll source materials for this website can be accessed at the [`r4wrds` Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds).\n\n<br>\n\n## Attribution\n\nContent in these lessons has been modified and/or adapted from [Data Carpentry: `R` for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.qmd), the USGS-R training curriculum [here](https://github.com/USGS-R/training-curriculum), the NCEAS Open Science for Synthesis workshop [here](https://nceas.github.io/oss-2017/index.qmd), [Mapping in `R`](https://ryanpeek.org/mapping-in-R-workshop/), and the wonderful text [`R` for data science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*site last updated: 2025-12-16 08:46*\n",
