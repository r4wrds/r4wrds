## Who is this course for?

What makes an *Intermediate `R` user*? This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who:

-   Took the [Introductory R4WRDS](../intro/index.html) course
-   Regularly use `R` and want improve their efficiency and skill set
-   Have a general understanding and proficiency in using `{dplyr}`, `{ggplot2}`, `{sf}`, and `{rmarkdown}`
-   Understand (and use) general best practices for data science in `R`

<br>

## Why `R`?

[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization.

<br>

## What will you learn?

In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic `R` skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a "stand-alone" lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn't necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.

**This course emphasizes:**

-   Intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency
-   Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data
-   The fundamentals of building Shiny Apps
-   Pulling water resources data from APIs
-   Intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing
-   Integrating version control in projects with git

## Project Setup and Data

All data used in this course is expected to live in a `/data` subfolder in a project directory. 

We will be working in an R project using RStudio. If you've already downloaded [**zipped data and Rproj file**](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/raw/main/r4wds_proj.zip) from the introductory course setup, you're already set and can move on to the modules. 

### Create a New Project

If you want to set up your own new RStudio project (*highly recommend for experience!*), we can create a new project file (`intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj`), in a few different ways. Directly from RStudio (detailed in the [introductory project management module](../intro/m_project_management.html#use-project-workflows)), or via the command line. We can use `touch intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj` (MacOS/Linux) or `echo > intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj` (Windows) in the root project directory.

To complete code exercises and follow along in the course, you will create a `/data` subfolder, and a `/scripts` subfolder to store `.R` scripts, which we recommend naming by module.

Your project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the `/data` subfolder):

    .
    ├── scripts
    │   ├── module_01.R
    │   └── module_02.R
    │   └── ...
    ├── data
    │   ├── gwl.csv
    │   └── polygon.shp
    │   └── ...
    └── intermediate_r4wrds.Rproj

### Download Data

Once an RStudio project has been created we can download the data in in a few ways:

1.  Download to a data folder in your project from a [Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/):

```{r}
    # downloads the data.zip file to the `data` directory
    dir.create("data")
    download.file("https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data/raw/main/data.zip", destfile = "data/data.zip")

    # unzip the data:
    unzip(zipfile = "data/data.zip")

    # if get resulting __MACOSX folder (artifact of unzip), remove:
    unlink("__MACOSX", recursive = TRUE)
```

2.  [Downloaded and unzipped from OSF](https://osf.io/qweju/download)

Once data have been downloaded and moved to a data folder, or downloaded directly into the project, we are ready to roll!
