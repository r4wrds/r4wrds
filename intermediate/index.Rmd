## Who is this course for?

What makes an *Intermediate `R` user*? This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who:

 - Took the [Introductory R4WRDS](../intro/index.html) course
 - Regularly use `R` and want improve their efficiency and skill set
 - Have a general understanding and proficiency in using `{dplyr}`, `{ggplot2}`, `{sf}`, and `{rmarkdown}`
 - Understand (and use) general best practices for data science in `R`

<br>

## Why `R`?

[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization.  

<br>

## What will you learn?

In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic `R` skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a "stand-alone" lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn't necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.

**This course emphasizes:**

 - Intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency
 - Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data
 - The fundamentals of building Shiny Apps
 - Pulling water resources data from APIs
 - Intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing
 - Integrating version control in projects with git

## Data

All data used in this course is expected to live in a `/data` subfolder in the project directory. It can be downloaded in 1 of 2 ways:

1. [Downloaded from the r4wrds-data-intermediate Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data-intermediate)  
2. [Cloned from the `r4wrds-data` Github repository](https://github.com/r4wrds/r4wrds-data)  

Your project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the `/data` subfolder):

```
.
├── code
│   ├── module_01.R
│   └── module_02.R
│   └── ...
├── data
│   ├── gwl.csv
│   └── polygon.shp
│   └── ...
└── intermediate.Rproj
```

To complete code exercises and follow along in the course, we will create an RStudio project (the `.Rproj` file), create these folders, and download the data needed, these steps are also covered in the [introductory project management module](../intro/m_project_management.html#use-project-workflows). 

Alternatively, on the command line, we can create the file using `touch intermediate.Rproj` (MacOS/Linux) or `echo > intermediate.Rproj` (Windows) in the root project directory.

## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.
