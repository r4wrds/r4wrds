## Who is this course for?

What makes an *Intermediate `R` user*? This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who:

 - Took the [Introductory R4WRDS](../intro/index.html) course
 - Regularly use `R` and want improve their efficiency and skill set
 - Have a general understanding and proficiency in using `{dplyr}`, `{ggplot2}`, `{sf}`, and `{rmarkdown}`
 - Understand (and use) general best practices for data science in `R`

## What will you learn?

In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic `R` skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a "stand-alone" lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn't necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.

**This course emphasizes:**

 - Intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency
 - Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data
 - The fundamentals of building Shiny Apps
 - Pulling water resources data from APIs
 - Intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing
 - Integrating version control in projects with git

## Why `R`?

[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization.  

<br>

## Workshop Overview

We will follow the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.
