This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who:\nTook the Introductory R4WRDS course\nRegularly use R and want improve their efficiency and skill set\nHave a general understanding and proficiency in using {dplyr}, {ggplot2}, {sf}, and {rmarkdown}\nUnderstand (and use) general best practices for data science in R\n\nWhy R?\nR is an open-source language for statistical computing and a general purpose programming language. It is one of the primary languages used for data science, modeling, and visualization.\n\nWhat will you learn?\nIn this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes:\nIntermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency\nApproaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data\nThe fundamentals of building Shiny Apps\nPulling water resources data from APIs\nIntermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing\nIntegrating version control in projects with git\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\nCourse Modules\nCheck/Update R/RStudio and Packages\nVersion Control with git\nProject Management and workflows\nInteractive visualization\nSimple shiny\nIteration and functional programming\nParameterized reports\nAdvanced spatial R and mapmaking\n\n\nData\nAll data used in this course is expected to live in a /data subfolder in the project directory. It can be downloaded in 1 of 2 ways:\nDownloaded and unzipped from OSF\nCloned from the wrds-data Github repository\nYour project directory structure should look like this (note the position of the /data subfolder):\n.\n├── code\n│   ├── module_01.R\n│   └── module_02.R\n│   └── ...\n├── data\n│   ├── gwl.csv\n│   └── polygon.shp\n│   └── ...\n└── intermediate.Rproj\nTo complete code exercises and follow along in the course, you will create a /code subfolder to store .R scripts, which we recommend naming by module.\nYou will also need to create an intro.Rproj file, covered in the introductory project management module. Alternatively, on the command line, use touch intro.Rproj (MacOS/Linux) or echo > intro.Rproj (Windows) in the root project directory.\n\nWorkshop Overview\nWe will follow the SFS Code of Conduct throughout our workshop.\n\nSource content\nAll source materials for this website can be accessed at the r4wrds Github repository.\n\nAttribution\nContent in these lessons has been modified and/or adapted from Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data, the USGS-R training curriculum here, the NCEAS Open Science for Synthesis workshop here, Mapping in R, and the wonderful text R for data science.\n\n\nNext module:1.

By sticking with one single framework or set of tools, we can reduce the mental workload necessary when switch between programs, staying organized in each, and dealing with import/export across multiple programs. Although different tools such as ESRI (or ArcPy extensions) are powerful, they require a paid license and typically use point-click user interfaces.\nThe advantage R has over these tools is that it is freely available, easily integrates with vast statistical/modeling toolboxes, has access to many spatial analysis and mapmaking tools, and allows us to work in a single place.\nIf we use a functional programming approach (described in the iteration module ) for spatial problems, R can be a very robust and powerful tool for analysis and spatial visualization of data! Furthermore, once analyses have been completed, we can re-use the scripts and functions for common spatial tasks (like making maps or exporting specific spatial files).\nCommon Geospatial Tasks\nCommon tasks in a GUI-based approach will always require the same number of point and clicks. With a script-based approach, it’s much easier to recycle previously written code, or to just change a variable and re-run the code. This efficiency is magnified immensely when it can be automated or iterated over the same task through time, or multiple data sets.\nFor example, some common tasks may include:\nCropping data to an area of interest for different users\nReproducing a map with updated data\nIntegrating or spatial joining of datasets\nReprojecting spatial data\nThe power of script-based analyses with {sf}\nThe {sf} package truly makes working with vector-based spatial data easy. We can use a pipeline that includes:\nst_read(): read spatial data in (e.g., shapefiles)\nst_transform(): transform or reproject data\nst_buffer(): buffer around data\nst_union(): combine data into one layer\nst_intersection(): crop or intersect one data by another\ngroup_split() & st_write() to split data by a column or attribute and write out\nThere are many more options that can be added or subtracted from these pieces, but at the core, we can use this very functional approach to provide data, make maps, conduct analysis, and so much more.\nA Climate/Hydrology Example\nLet’s use an example where we take global climate data, crop it to an area of interest, join it to additional data, and finally, write it back out a few counties of interest in California (Yolo, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Sutter).\nThe Packages\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(USAboundaries)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(GSODR)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(mapview)      # interactive maps!\nmapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)\n\n\n\nImporting Spatial Data\nWe’ll leverage the ability to pull in many different data and stitch them all together through joins (spatial or common attributes). Each data component may be comprised of one or more “layers”, which ultimately we can use on a map.\nGet State & County Data\nFirst we need state and county boundaries. The {USAboundaries} package is excellent for this.\n\n\n# get USA states, filter out Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii for now\nus <- USAboundaries::us_boundaries(type = \"state\", resolution = \"low\") %>% \n  filter(!state_abbr %in% c(\"PR\", \"AK\", \"HI\"))\n\n# get CA boundary with high definition\nca <- USAboundaries::us_states(resolution = \"high\", states = \"CA\")\n\n# make a box around CA (a grid with an n=1) for inset\nca_box <- st_make_grid(ca, n = 1)\n\n# get CA county boundary\nca_co <- USAboundaries::us_counties(resolution = \"high\", states = \"CA\")\n\n# make sure we have all the pieces with a quick test plot\nplot(us$geometry)\nplot(ca$geometry, add = T, col = \"gray50\", border = \"maroon\")\nplot(ca_co$geometry, add = T, border = \"pink\", col = NA)\nplot(ca_box, add = T, border = \"red3\", col = NA, lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nGet Climate Data from the GSODR\nNext let’s take historical global climate data stations (Global Surface Summary of the Day = GSOD1) and filter to stations that are just in California.\n\n\n# load the isd_history file (which ships with {GSODR}):\nload(system.file(\"extdata\", \"isd_history.rda\", package = \"GSODR\"))\n\n# make spatial\nisd_history <- as.data.frame(isd_history) %>% \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"LON\", \"LAT\"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)  \n\n# filter to US and CA, many sites out in buoys along coast\nisd_history_ca <- dplyr::filter(isd_history, CTRY == \"US\", STATE == \"CA\")\n\n\n\nNow let’s plot all the stations globally and see what we have. Here we can leverage the many points to actually help fill out our global outlines a bit (there are 26531 stations to work with!).\n\n\n# view!\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\n\n# get countries\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n# plot\nplot(isd_history$geometry, pch = 16, cex = 0.2, col = \"gray50\")\nplot(world$geometry, add = T, border = \"gray10\")\nplot(ca$geometry, col = \"maroon\", add = TRUE)\ntitle(\"GSOD Climate Stations\")\n\n\n\n\nFilter, Select, & Spatial Joins\nNext we can zoom into just California. There are 447 total stations we can work with, but not all counties have stations.\n\n\n# look at CA sites only\nplot(ca$geometry, col = alpha(\"gray\", 0.5), border = \"#440154FF\", lwd = 1.5)\nplot(ca_co$geometry, add = T, border = \"purple\", col = NA)\nplot(isd_history_ca$geometry, add = T, pch = 21, bg = \"#21908CFF\", \n     cex = 0.7, col = \"black\")\ntitle(\"GSOD Climate Stations labeled as CA\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can leverage the data.frame aspect of {sf} and quickly filter down to the counties of interest (Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Sacramento, and Sutter), and select a single station from each county that has a station.\nFirst we filter to 4 specific counties, then we can use a spatial join to merge the information associated with the climate data stations. Note, we are using a spatial join here and selecting polygons (counties) that contain points (GSOD stations).\nWe can also use an anti_join (the !) to find counties that contain no stations. These operations can be helpful when exploring and understanding a dataset, to identify gaps, highlight specific areas, etc.\n\n\n# get specific counties\nca_co_select <- ca_co %>% filter(name %in% \n                                   c(\"Sacramento\",\n                                     \"San Joaquin\", \n                                     \"Sutter\"))\n\n# check CRS is the same\nidentical(st_crs(ca_co_select)$epsg, st_crs(isd_history)$epsg)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# SPATIAL JOIN: Get CA county POLYGONS that contain ISD points \n# does not bring attributes from points forward\nca_co_isd_poly <- ca_co_select[isd_history_ca, ]\n\n# anti_join: find counties that don't contain ISD points\nca_co_poly_anti <- ca_co[!lengths(st_intersects(ca_co, isd_history_ca)), ]\n\n# plot of all CA counties with and without ISD stations\nplot(ca_co$geometry, col = alpha(\"gray70\", 0.3))\n#plot(ca_co_select$geometry, col = alpha(\"gray\", 0.3))\nplot(ca_co_poly_anti$geometry, col = alpha(\"purple\", 0.3), add = TRUE)\nplot(ca_co_isd_poly$geometry, col = alpha(\"forestgreen\", 0.6), add = TRUE)\nplot(isd_history_ca$geometry, add = T, pch = 21, bg = \"yellow\", \n     cex = 0.5, col = \"black\")\ntitle(\"Counties with GSOD ISD Stations (green)\\n No Stations (purple)\")\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows there are 2 counties (green polygons) from our focus list that have GSOD stations. Let’s find out some more info on the specific stations from our counties of interest, and pull one station per county. In this case, let’s pull the station that has the most data (or longest period of time), so we can join these data to the nearest groundwater station.\nWe can also use st_join() directly to filter for points that fall within a supplied polygon(s). In our case, we want GSOD stations (points) that fall within our selected counties (polygons).\nWhen can also spatially join 2 {sf} dataframes, with [ ] notation as shown in the county joins above. st_join() and [ ] are equivalent when spatial data share the same CRS.\n\n\nisd_select <- st_join(isd_history_ca, ca_co_isd_poly, left = FALSE)\n\nmapview(isd_select, zcol = \"name\", layer.name = \"County\") +\n  mapview(ca_co_isd_poly, alpha = 0.5, legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"minZoom\":1,\"maxZoom\":52,\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}},\"preferCanvas\":false,\"bounceAtZoomLimits\":false,\"maxBounds\":[[[-90,-370]],[[90,370]]]},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.Positron\",\"CartoDB.Positron\",\"CartoDB.Positron\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false,\"pane\":\"tilePane\"}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.DarkMatter\",\"CartoDB.DarkMatter\",\"CartoDB.DarkMatter\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false,\"pane\":\"tilePane\"}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"OpenStreetMap\",\"OpenStreetMap\",\"OpenStreetMap\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false,\"pane\":\"tilePane\"}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"Esri.WorldImagery\",\"Esri.WorldImagery\",\"Esri.WorldImagery\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false,\"pane\":\"tilePane\"}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"OpenTopoMap\",\"OpenTopoMap\",\"OpenTopoMap\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false,\"pane\":\"tilePane\"}]},{\"method\":\"createMapPane\",\"args\":[\"point\",440]},{\"method\":\"addCircleMarkers\",\"args\":[[38.507,38.567,38.555,38.567,38.667,38.668,38.696,38.683,37.889,38.507,37.889,38.555],[-121.495,-121.3,-121.297,-121.3,-121.4,-121.401,-121.59,-121.583,-121.226,-121.495,-121.226,-121.418],6,null,\"County\",{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}},\"pane\":\"point\",\"stroke\":true,\"color\":\"#333333\",\"weight\":1,\"opacity\":[0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9],\"fill\":true,\"fillColor\":[\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#4B0055\",\"#FDE333\",\"#4B0055\",\"#FDE333\",\"#4B0055\"],\"fillOpacity\":[0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6]},null,null,[\"<div

Spatial Data Out\nWe may want to save these data and send to colleagues before we proceed with further analysis. As we’ve shown before2, functional programming allows us to split data and write it out for future use, or to share and distribute. Here we use a fairly simple example, but the concept can be expanded.\nLet’s use the {purrr} package to iterate over two different lists and write them to a geopackage (a self contained spatial database). Geopackages are a great way to save vector-based spatial data, they can be read by ArcGIS and spatial software, and they are compact and self-contained (unlike shapefiles).\n\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# first split ISD data by county:\nisd_select_split <- isd_select %>% \n  rename(cnty_name = name) %>% # avoid duplicate names\n  group_split(cnty_name) # split by cnty name\n\n# split county data by county\nca_co_select_split <- ca_co_isd_poly %>% \n  rename(cnty_name = name) %>% # avoid duplicate names\n  group_split(cnty_name) # split by cnty name\n\n# make a list of clean names with janitor pkg\nclean_cnty_names <- make_clean_names(ca_co_isd_poly$name)\n\n# now apply function to write out points by county\nmap2(isd_select_split, # list of points\n     clean_cnty_names, # list of cnty names\n     ~st_write(.x, \n               dsn = glue(\"data/{.y}_gsod.gpkg\"),\n               layer = glue(\"{.y}_isd_pts\")))\n\n# to add additional layers we can do the same with a diff layer\nmap2(ca_co_select_split, # list of points\n     clean_cnty_names, #list of cnty names\n     ~st_write(.x, \n               dsn = glue(\"data/{.y}_gsod.gpkg\"),\n               layer = glue(\"{.y}_isd_cnty\")))\n\n\n\n We use map2() here, but can also use walk2(), which is a “silent” map that doesn’t print any output to the console.\nTo make sure this worked as intended, we can check what layers exist in each of these geopackages with the st_layers function.\n\n\n# check layers in one of gpkg files:\nmap(c(\"sacramento\", \"san_joaquin\"), \n    ~st_layers(glue(\"data/{.x}_gsod.gpkg\")))\n\n\n[[1]]\nDriver: GPKG \nAvailable layers:\n           layer_name geometry_type features fields\n1  sacramento_isd_pts         Point        2     23\n2 sacramento_isd_cnty Multi Polygon        1     12\n3 sacramento_isd_data            NA    17524     47\n\n[[2]]\nDriver: GPKG \nAvailable layers:\n            layer_name geometry_type features fields\n1  san_joaquin_isd_pts         Point       10     23\n2 san_joaquin_isd_cnty Multi Polygon        1     12\n3 san_joaquin_isd_data            NA    17040     47\n\n\nWrangling GSOD Data\nBefore we can download the actual climate data, we want to use our subset of climate stations and filter these down to one per county. Let’s use the station with the longest period of record, and pair it with additional data.\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# calculate the duration of data for each station\nisd_stations <- isd_select %>% \n  mutate(date_begin = ymd(BEGIN),\n         date_end = ymd(END), \n         tot_yrs = interval(date_begin, date_end) %>% \n           time_length(\"year\") %>% \n           round(1)\n         )\n\n# group by county name\nisd_stations_keep <- isd_stations %>% \n  group_by(name) %>% \n  filter(tot_yrs > 1) %>% \n  # get the station with the longest set of data\n  filter(tot_yrs == max(tot_yrs)) %>% \n  select(STNID:LON, tot_yrs) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\nglimpse(isd_stations_keep)\n\n\nRows: 2\nColumns: 6\n$ STNID    <chr> \"724836-23208\", \"724920-23237\"\n$ NAME     <chr> \"SACRAMENTO MCCLELLAN AFB\", \"STOCKTON METROPOLITAN …\n$ LAT      <dbl> 38.667, 37.889\n$ LON      <dbl> -121.400, -121.226\n$ tot_yrs  <dbl> 81.2, 80.0\n$ geometry <POINT [°]> POINT (-121.4 38.667), POINT (-121.226 37.889)\n\nDownload GSOD Data\nWe are nearly done! Finally we can pull climate data for our stations of interest and join these data. We’ll add the GSOD data to our geopackage databases for each respective county to keep our data all together in one place.\nTo download the data, we use the get_GSOD function. Note, this can take a few minutes, so for this example, the data have been pre-saved here.\n\n\n# get data (this takes a few minutes!):\nclimdata <- get_GSOD(station = isd_stations_keep$STNID, years = c(1960:2020))\n\n\n\nWrite GSOD Data\nThe data is large (>30,000 observations), so let’s write it out to the geopackage first (in case something breaks later!).\n\n\n# to add additional layers we can

First, let’s calculate the monthly and daily averages for air temperature and precipitation at each of our sites.\n\n\n# MONTHLY AVG:\nclim_month <- climdata %>% \n  filter(!is.na(PRCP)) %>% # filter out missing data\n  filter(!is.na(TEMP)) %>% \n  group_by(NAME, STNID, MONTH) %>% \n  summarize(\n    across(c(\"TEMP\",\"PRCP\"), list(min = min, mean = mean, max = max))\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nThen we can plot a polar plot!\n\n\n# monthly prcp\n(mPPT <- ggplot() + \n  geom_col(data = clim_month, \n           aes(x = MONTH, y = PRCP_mean,\n               fill = PRCP_mean), show.legend = T) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 4, 7, 10),\n                     labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Apr\", \"Jul\", \"Oct\")) +\n  theme(plot.background = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"left\",\n        #legend.position = c(-0.25, 0.55),\n        legend.key.height = unit(.15, units = \"in\"),\n        legend.key.width = unit(.1, units = \"in\"), \n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0 ,0), \"mm\")) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\"Mean \\nPPT(in)\") +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Monthly Mean Precipitation (1960-2020)\",\n       caption = \n         \"Data from the {GSODR} package: https://ropensci.github.io/GSODR/\")+\n  coord_polar() + \n  facet_wrap(clim_month$NAME~., nrow = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# take mean daily temp/precip values\nclim_day <- climdata %>% \n  filter(!is.na(PRCP)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(TEMP)) %>% \n  group_by(NAME, STNID, YDAY) %>% \n  summarize(\n    across(c(\"TEMP\", \"PRCP\"), list(min = min, mean = mean, max = max))\n  )\n\n# plot\n(dTEMP <- ggplot() + \n    geom_col(data = clim_day, \n             aes(x = YDAY, y = TEMP_mean,\n                 fill = TEMP_mean), show.legend = T) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n    labs(y = \"\", x = \"\",\n         subtitle = \"Daily mean air temperature (1960-2020)\",\n         caption = \n           \"Data from the {GSODR} package: https://ropensci.github.io/GSODR/\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 90, 180, 270),\n                       labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Apr\", \"Jul\", \"Oct\")) +\n    theme(plot.background = element_blank(),\n          legend.position = \"left\",\n          #legend.position = c(-0.25, 0.55),\n          legend.key.height = unit(.15,units = \"in\"),\n          legend.key.width = unit(.1, units = \"in\"), \n          panel.border = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0 ,0), \"mm\")) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_c(\"Mean Air \\n Temp(C)\") +\n    coord_polar() + \n    facet_wrap(NAME~., nrow = 1))\n\n\n\n\nBuffers\nNow that we have some climate stations in each county, but we may want to look for nearby stations or lines and join to additional data (e.g., groundwater stations, or surface water USGS stations). One approach we can use is to generate a buffer from each of our selected climate stations, and search within the buffer to find nearby sites or data localities.\nTo buffer our data, we need to use a projected coordinate reference system3 (not latitude/longitude), so we can specify things in units that are easier to understand (kilometers or miles) instead of arc degrees, and so that the calculations take place correctly.\n\n\n# transform our points\nisd_stations_keep <- st_transform(isd_stations_keep, 3310)\n\n# now buffer 5km around each station as our window to look within\nisd_stations_buff_5km <- st_buffer(isd_stations_keep, dist = 5000) %>% \n  # transform back to proj of other components\n  st_transform(st_crs(ca_co_isd_poly))\n\nisd_stations_keep <-

Nearest USGS Station & Download Data\nWith our buffered data, we can look for the nearest USGS station, which gives us the ability to pull water quality data, discharge, water temperature, and so on using packages like {dataRetrieval}.\nLet’s use our 2 stations of interest and find the nearest USGS stations. The findNLDI function allows us to pass a single spatial point as well as a few different parameters like search upstream or downstream, and what we want to find, and then return a list of items (see the help page for using the function here), leveraging the hydro-network linked data index (NLDI)4.\nLet’s look only at downstream mainstem flowlines from our points, and return the nearest NWIS sites as well as the NHD flowlines (streamlines). We’ll use the map() function to pass a list of stations along (here only 2, but this is flexible, and in practice we can map over a much larger number of stations).\nIf there are issues downloading

the Nearest Point\nThe final filter involves snapping our ISD station points (n = 2) to the nearest USGS stations from the stations we filtered to above. We can then use these data to generate some analysis and exploratory plots.\nSnapping spatial data can be tricky, mainly because decimal precision can cause problems. One solution is to add a slight buffer around points or lines to improve successful pairing.\nFor this example, we’ll use st_nearest_feature(), which gives us an index of the nearest feature (row) between two sets of spatial data. In this case, we have two sets of points.\n\n\n# get row index of nearest feature between points:\nusgs_nearest_index <- st_nearest_feature(isd_stations_keep, usgs_stations)\n\n# now filter using the row index\nusgs_stations_final <- usgs_stations[usgs_nearest_index, ]\n\n# get vector of distances from each ISD station to nearest USGS station\ndist_to_isd <- st_distance(isd_stations_keep, \n                           usgs_stations_final, \n                           by_element = TRUE)\n\n# use units package to convert units to miles or km\n(dist_to_isd_mi <- units::set_units(dist_to_isd, miles))\n\n\nUnits: [miles]\n[1] 7.957188 6.225841\n\n(dist_to_isd_km <- units::set_units(dist_to_isd, km))\n\n\nUnits: [km]\n[1] 12.80585 10.01952\n\n# bind back to final

Nearest by Distance\nIf we want to select more than a single point based on a threshold distance we can use a non-overlapping join and specify a distance. For many spatial operations, using a projected CRS is important because it generally provides a more accurate calculation since it is based on a “flat” surface and uses a linear grid. It has the additional advantage that we tend to process and understand information that is grid based more easily than curvilinear (degree-based), so a distance of 100 yards or 100 meters makes sense when compared with 0.001 degrees.\nTherefore, first we transform our data into a projected CRS, then we do our join and distance calculations, then we can transform back to our lat/lon CRS.\n\n\nusgs_stations <- st_transform(usgs_stations, 3310)\nisd_stations_keep <- st_transform(isd_stations_keep, 3310)\n\n# use a search within 30km to select stations\nusgs_stations_30km <-

To do this, we can leverage handy functions from the {tidyr} package: complete() and fill().\n\n\nClick for Answers!\n\n\n\n# load the package\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# fill all unique combinations of Date in our data\nwTemp2 <- wTemp %>% \n  complete(Date = seq.Date(min(Date), max(Date), by=\"day\")) %>% \n  # then list the cols we want to fill same value through whole dataset\n  fill(site_no, agency_cd)\n\n# now regenerate plot!\n# Plot temp\n(gg_temp2 <- ggplot() + \n    geom_path(data = wTemp2, \n              aes(x = Date, y = Wtemp, col = site_no),\n              size = .5) + \n    facet_wrap(~site_no) + \n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(title=\"USGS Water Temperature Data (1960-2020)\",\n         x=\"\", y=\"Water Temperature (C)\") +\n    scale_color_viridis_d() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a Map with {tmap}\nOne final component that we haven’t covered much is how to create a publication ready-map. We can do this using the {ggplot2} package in conjunction with geom_sf(), or we can use some alternate packages which are built specifically to work with spatial data and use a similar code structure to {ggplot2}.\nThe {tmap} and {tmaptools} are excellent options to create a nice map that can be used in any report or publication. First, let’s load the packages we’ll use.\n\n\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(tmaptools)\n\n\n\nNext we can download a basemap layer to use in our map. For this we need to specify an area of interest for the . We can use the rivers layer we pulled previously using the {dataRetrieval} package. For this, we can use the st_box() to get an extent. Then we can use the read_osm function to pull data in.\nNote, the read_osm function requires {rJava}, which may be tricky to install. See this post on Github for a potential way to resolve these issues.\n\n\n# create a boundary box\nst_bbox(ca_co_isd_poly)\n# get baselayer\nbase_osm <- read_osm(ca_co_isd_poly, type = \"esri-topo\", raster = TRUE)\n\n\n\nOnce we have a base layer, we can make our plot!\n\n\nfinal_tmap <-\n  # basemap\n  tm_shape(base_osm) + \n  tm_rgb() +\n  \n  # counties\n  tm_shape(ca_co_isd_poly) +\n  tm_polygons(border.col = \"gray50\", col = \"gray50\", \n              alpha = 0.1, border.alpha = 0.9, lwd = 0.5, lty = 1) +\n  # basins\n  tm_shape(nldi_SACRA$basin) +\n  tm_polygons(border.col = \"cyan4\", col = \"cyan4\", \n              alpha = 0.8, border.alpha = 0.9, lwd = 0.3, lty = 2) +\n  tm_shape(nldi_STOCK$basin) +\n  tm_polygons(border.col = \"cyan4\", col = \"cyan4\", \n              alpha = 0.8, border.alpha = 0.9, lwd = 0.3, lty = 2) +\n  # rivers\n  tm_shape(nldi_SACRA$DM_flowlines) +\n  tm_lines(col = \"steelblue\", lwd = 2) +\n  tm_shape(nldi_STOCK$DM_flowlines) +\n  tm_lines(col=\"steelblue\", lwd = 2) +\n  # points: ISD stations\n  tm_shape(isd_stations_keep) +\n    tm_symbols(col = \"orange3\", border.col = \"gray20\", \n               shape = 21, size = 2.5, alpha = 1) +\n  # points usgs\n  tm_shape(usgs_stations) +\n    tm_symbols(col = \"gray50\", border.col = \"gray20\", \n               shape = 21, size = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +\n  # points usgs\n  tm_shape(usgs_stations_final) +\n    tm_symbols(col = \"yellow\", border.col = \"gray20\", \n               shape = 21, size = 1.8) +\n  # layout\n    tm_layout(\n              frame = FALSE,\n              legend.outside = FALSE, attr.outside = FALSE,\n              inner.margins = 0.01, outer.margins = (0.01),\n              #legend.position = c(0.6,0.85),\n              title.position = c(0.7, 0.95)) +\n    tm_compass(type = \"4star\", position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\")) +\n    tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\nfinal_tmap\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting rasters, we can specify the resolution that gets plotted using tmap_options(max.raster = c(plot = 1e6)). We can also specify a value for the view(). This helps speed up plotting when necessary.\nTo save this map, we use a similar function as the ggsave(), but in this case, it’s tmap::tmap_save().\n\n\ntmap::tmap_save(final_tmap, \n                filename = here(\"images\",\"map_of_sites.jpg\"),\n                height = 11, width = 8, units = \"in\", dpi = 300)\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\nWe’ve covered a handful of packages and functions in this module, but many more exist that solve just about every spatial workflow task. All spatial and mapmaking operations are typically a websearch away, but we also recommend the following resources to dig deeper into the R spatial universe.\n\n\nPrevious module:7. Paramaterized reports\n\nFor more about the GSOD data, see NOAA’s site here.↩︎\nSee the iteration module for an example of iterating over a write function.↩︎\nA discussion on coordinate reference systems is a complex topic in and of itself, and for the purposes of this module, we summarize it as follows: A geographic CRS is round and based on angular units of degrees (lat/lng), whereas a projected CRS is flat and has linear units (meters or feet). Many functions in {sf} that make calculations on data expect a projected CRS, and can return inaccurate results if an object in a geographic CRS is used. This is a fascinating topic with lots written about it!

Visualization is one of R’s strengths, and there are a seemingly constantly growing number of packages that can assist you in customizing just about any visualization you can think of. Importantly, this allows users to access and interact with data on a level that would not otherwise be possible.\nBecause we can learn new things and develop new questions by effectively interacting with data, the ability to stitch raw data into something visual can help provide unique insight that may be much harder to discern with a table or some raw data.\nLet’s demonstrate a simple way we can collect data, update it automagically, and visualize in a fairly streamlined manner. Keep in mind, this is one approach, but there are many more, with increasing complexity. But for illustration, “working” examples (as in, it works when you try it!) are the best way to build your proficiency in R programming.\n\nMapping with Geocoder\nThis example will couple the power of collecting user input (favorite places to eat/drink) with interactive mapping. We’ll use a Form to collect some data, and then display that via a map. This illustrates some of the power (and fun!) of programming in R.\nCollect Data\nAnswer as many questions as you feel comfortable, but at minimum, the street address/name of your favorite place to eat or get a beverage (hot or cold).\n\nLoading…\n\nImport and Map Data\nWe’ll need these packages to work with this data.\n\n\nlibrary(tidygeocoder) # geocode our addresses\nlibrary(tidyverse)    # wrangle data\nlibrary(janitor)      # clean column names\nlibrary(glue)         # modern paste() function\nlibrary(sf)           # make spatial data\nlibrary(mapview)      # interactive maps!\nmapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)\n\n\n\nThe entire script we need is below (don’t forget to include the packages above). To generate a public .csv from a Form, we can use File > Publish to the Web1. Importantly, here we are publishing to a .csv so we can read the data in directly and simply using read_csv. We then clean, convert it into an sf object, and map!\n\n\n# the url for the Form data \nform_data <- paste0(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/\",\n                    \"2PACX-1vSODxBm_z5Gu8a42C6ZFEa3S5iTbYV-\",\n                    \"qucCGvasGS6c0qFUAml5vSMEgbvI9PYo1HJ20Y_WY62aTAb-\",\n                    \"/pub?gid=1462593645&single=true&output=csv\")\n\n# read in

This is a handy shortcut instead of having to save the object p <- my_code and then call/print the object p. We use (p <- my_code).\nIf we wanted to save this interactive visualization and send it as a standalone .html file, we could use the following code:\n\n\n# save the widget\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\nsaveWidget(p, file = here(\"output\",\"network_interactive.html\"))\n\n\n\n\nPlotly\nAnother great tool for interacting with data is the {plotly} package, which if using the {ggplot2} framework, has a very handy ggplotly() function which you can wrap around pretty much any ggplot to turn a static plot into an interactive one. This allows you to click, hover, zoom, etc. inside your plot, and is a very useful tool for exploring data.\nFor example, say you were asked to find the date of a peak flow for a given year, or an outlier in a graph. We could figure this out with dplyr::filter() and additional queries of our data, but it would also be easy to visually look and see the date of peak flow on a plot. This is where the power of plotly can be very helpful.\nLet’s use the CalEnviroScreen data from Sacramento County from a previous module. Recall, higher scores mean a higher impact of pollution to a community.\n\n\n# load CES data for Sacramento county\nces3_sac <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"ces3_sac.rds\"))\n\nmapview(ces3_sac,

make a static plot that shows the association between groundwater threats and the CES score. The trend is interesting, but what if we want to know what census tracts are associated with outliers (high or low) on this static plot?\n\n\n# plot of Groundwater threats vs. CES score\n(ces_plot <- ces3_sac %>% \n   ggplot(aes(x = gwthreatsP, y = CIscoreP, label = tract)) + \n   geom_point() +\n   geom_smooth(method = \"gam\") +\n   cowplot::theme_half_open(font_size = 12) +\n   labs(\n     title = \"CES Score vs. Groundwater Threats in Sacramento County\",\n     subtitle = \"Higher CI Score indicates higher threat/impact\",\n     x = \"Groundwater Threats (percentile)\", \n     y = \"CI Score (percentile)\"\n   )\n)\n\n\n\n\nTry wrapping the exact plot above with ggplotly(). Now we can quickly interact and select data of interest. Try hovering your pointer over a point on the plot below. Or, click and drag to select a specific region of the plot to zoom into just that region. You can double click to return to the original zoom level. Visual inspection like so can help us quickly explore large and complex datasets, and identify the next step in our workflow.\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nggplotly(ces_plot)\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[43,0,0,89,43,57,22,38,0,93,61,61,15,62,96,97,88,91,0,0,2,0,0,0,27,0,100,61,32,97,65,22,0,41,42,2,0,66,25,29,46,76,59,72,2,22,93,32,0,22,92,100,0,9,32,22,43,0,33,27,59,0,0,38,29,38,0,22,4,0,0,57,77,77,50,50,25,6,14,77,61,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,22,0,22,16,25,14,27,9,59,100,0,0,0,14,2,68,0,68,55,81,69,51,16,69,0,0,0,0,0,56,73,41,82,83,33,87,72,38,0,0,2,46,0,0,23,22,0,61,73,61,74,14,0,51,0,96,70,22,0,54,32,41,14,83,81,29,9,9,50,88,0,98,72,0,0,32,66,0,0,24,61,9,77,15,9,0,25,97,63,58,88,68,36,41,96,4,0,71,66,66,85,44,0,38,0,0,25,69,73,85,39,75,82,72,32,0,0,0,0,46,22,22,0,0,89,71,91,53,74,71,79,65,51,6,68,15,90,46,91,89,79,0,23,0,85,99,100,0,0,72,0,72,55,82,24,73,58,73,74,68,0,72,32,61,50,50,32,75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,92,92,97,95,87,96,95,25,90,83,22,14,43,50,0,15,0,2,0,0,9,0,22,43,0,87,83,95,97,77,94,94,82,73,52,6,0,4,53,33,15,46,100,22,0,0,98,43,0,0,24,4,82,100,0,3,43,0,68,39,2,50,0,0,22,2,22,0,2,92,96,0,76,89,37,92,96,96,91,14,0,0,61,14,96,95],\"y\":[50,19,9,56,22,30,14,39,1,65,3,8,18,46,39,69,80,90,1,2,10,36,28,24,26,28,90,58,63,68,55,24,14,52,31,49,43,27,54,78,84,91,89,89,44,40,95,62,51,24,87,91,24,35,81,71,38,30,42,51,55,24,57,64,58,4,35,29,3,28,38,74,21,35,32,23,15,23,43,43,23,32,24,40,51,56,52,57,13,32,36,33,43,41,32,24,12,53,73,34,60,50,49,62,24,15,48,34,30,53,53,28,45,30,15,31,14,61,54,57,81,81,73,71,66,55,74,50,62,53,79,62,36,68,39,13,27,23,17,21,34,39,72,2,92,75,85,70,70,71,51,71,79,87,44,71,76,20,54,52,90,80,34,51,52,54,47,72,72,67,26,31,32,12,21,34,67,46,91,88,93,91,82,90,69,24,73,62,65,58,69,14,33,25,18,19,82,83,79,71,76,64,66,67,28,48,21,18,52,25,26,27,30,49,50,59,78,65,51,53,50,34,30,83,56,78,64,67,63,58,43,19,25,58,72,49,24,3,20,4,51,72,56,54,69,39,10,33,35,23,58,55,52,32,58,50,80,2,42,15,21,33,32,42,94,87,87,61,75,57,23,36,84,74,42,26,40,58,33,61,26,23,15,19,0,51,51,48,72,32,55,69,66,77,97,89,87,55,28,12,29,7,23,70,14,24,23,54,39,31,99,0,14,21,40,32,38,58,9,12,43,35,71,89,18,16,21,35,29,63,48,36,57,61,55,23,65,57,52,66,78,74,85,60,1,2,17,6,74,58],\"text\":[\"gwthreatsP:

are many options to make very fancy visualizations in R, but remember to consider the objective of your work, and how to use visualization as a tool to communicate with the end user. Stories are powerful, and although a flashy visualization may grab someone’s attention, it will have more impact if it tells a story. At other times, the end user of interactive data visualization is you (the analyst!), as interactive visualization is an important tool for Exploratory Data Analysis (see the EDA module).\nWhatever the visualization, if it communicates data in a way that provides new insight, or provides a easier medium to transfer information (i.e., with an Rmarkdown document), the ability to quickly take data, transform it, and visualize it is a powerful skill to practice.\n\nAdditional Resources\nRmarkdown Flexdashboard\n{r2d3} Visualizations\nRGraph Gallery\nAll things Shiny\nNetwork visualization\n\n\nPrevious module:3.

This makes R expressive, and as you practice and expand your R vocabulary, you’ll inevitably find multiple ways to obtain the same results. Some ways may be long and meandering, and others may be more direct and easy to remember. In this module we will practice two approaches towards iteration—the art of not repeating yourself—specifically, for loops1 and functions (functional programming).\nFor most parallel problems (i.e., the current operation does not depend on the one that came before), functional programming offers significant advantages to for loops. However, both loops and functions are powerful ways to automate processes and workflows. We will review how and when to use each, and their pros and cons.\nThe core objective of this lesson is to practice harnessing the power of iteration in your workflows, and to demonstrate ways to iterate with functional programming. If you can define a function to work with one object in R, functional programming allows you to scale that function to any number of objects (assuming you have enough computing resources). Together, functional programming and iteration allow automation at scale, and put R a cut above GUI-based data workflows that require “clicking though” an analysis.\nProficiency in functional programming means you can turn an entire workflow into a function, or individual steps for a workflow can each be discrete functions, making it easy to reproduce or revise your work.\nProficiency in iteration means you can apply developed functions many times with little effort, which allows you to work with small or large datasets with ease.\nProficiency in automation means you can remove yourself from running the code entirely so that it happens all on its own—we will demonstrate approaches to automation in the next module.\nIn this module, let’s imagine you’re a data manager, and need to provide data to a group of users. We’ll practice iteration on reading and writing data to illustrate a transition from for loops to functional programming.\n\nfor loops\n\n“Don’t repeat yourself. It’s not only repetitive, it’s redundant, and people have heard it before.” -Lemony Snicket\n\nThe for loop is ubiquitous across programming languages and a fundamental concept that allows us to obey a core concept in programming: don’t repeat yourself. The for loop is a good place to begin a discussion of iteration because it makes iteration very explicit—you can see exactly what is taking place in each iteration, or loop.\nA common problem we might face is reading multiple data frames into R. In the /data/gwl folder, we have station data for El Dorado, Placer, and Sacramento counties. We can read these in one by one by copy and pasting code, but we’re repeating ourselves. This may not matter for only 3 counties, but if we were to use all 58 counties with groundwater level data, this would be a non-scaleable approach prone to human error.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\neldorado <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"county\", \"El Dorado.csv\"))\nplacer   <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"county\", \"Placer.csv\"))\nsac      <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"county\", \"Sacramento.csv\"))\n\n\n\nWe can replace this code with a for loop and read all of these items into a list2.\n\n\n# list all files we want to read in\nfiles_in <- list.files(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"county\"), full.names = TRUE)\n\n# initialize a list of defined length\nl <- vector(\"list\", length = length(files_in))\n\n# loop over all files and read them into each element of the list\nfor(i in seq_along(l)){\n  l[[i]] <- read_csv(files_in[i])\n}\n\n\n\nAfter the loop finished, if you run i in the console, you’ll notice that it has a value of 3. That’s because i is updated as the loop evaluates, and 3 is the last iteration of i in the loop. This can be useful when debugging a loop because the last index that the loop was evaluated may identify the location of a problem that breaks the loop.\nWhat happened above is that we evaluated the loop first starting with 1 in the place of i, and went to length(l), which is 3, each time placing the integer wherever there is an i in the above loop. Although our index is i, we can use any other unquoted character string, like j, k, or even index — its only purpose is to hold the index that we iterate through.\nAfter the loop evaluates, we can access each element of the list with double bracket [[ notation, subsetting either by an integer index, or a name if one exists. This list doesn’t have names, but we could set them by assigning a vector of names to names(l).\n\n\n# access first list element - El Dorado county dataframe\nl[[1]] \n\n\n\nfor loops happen sequentially, and require us to think of code in terms of objects that we iterate through, index by index. This can result in both slower and duplicated (verbose) code. In addition to writing efficient code, a core rule of good programming is to not repeat oneself.\nLet’s imagine now that you needed to write each of these data into a separate file, separated by the unique ID of each station (e.g., the SITE_CODE). Your entire loop would look like this:\n\n\n# initialize a list of defined length\nl <- vector(\"list\", length = length(files_in))\n\n# loop over all files and read them into each element of the list\nfor(i in seq_along(l)){\n  l[[i]] <- read_csv(files_in[i])\n}\n\n# combine all list elements into a single dataframe\n# then split into another list by SITE_CODE.\nldf <- bind_rows(l)\nldf <- split(ldf, ldf$SITE_CODE)\n\n# loop over each list element and write a csv file\ndir.create(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"site_code\"))\n# here we make a list of files names ( names(ldf) is a vector )\nfiles_out <- glue::glue(\"{here('data', 'gwl', 'site_code', names(ldf))}.csv\")\n\nfor(i in seq_along(ldf)){\n  write_csv(ldf[[i]], files_out[i])\n}\n\n\n\ndplyr::bind_rows(l) row binds a list of data.frames similar to base R’s do.call(rbind.data.frame, l), but is more strict, and will throw an error if column types don’t match.\n\n\n\nThis is a lot of code to accomplish a relatively standard iterative workflow of reading in a directory of files, combining them, and writing them out. Functional programming can simplify loop-based workflows, run faster, and encourage you to think conceptually about the transformations at play, without worrying about tracking a changing index. Moreover, loops in R are usually unnecessary unless the result of the ith index depends on the i-1 (previous) index.\nlapply()\nBase R gives us a toolkit for functional programming via the apply family of functions, specifically lapply() and mapply(). The “l” in lapply() stands for “list”, and can be read as “list apply”. The apply functions are designed to iterate over lists, matrices, rows, or columns, and are very flexible. For example, we can simplify the for loops above as:\n\n\n# read\nl <- lapply(files_in, read_csv)\n\n# bind and split by SITE_CODE\nldf <- bind_rows(l)\nldf <- split(ldf, ldf$SITE_CODE)\n\n# write out: requires function (write_csv) \n# with 2 args (x = ldf & y = files_out)\nmapply(function(x, y) write_csv(x, y), ldf, files_out) \n\n\n\nWe can make this clearer by extracting the anonymous function3 above, assigning it to an identifier, and calling that in mapply():\n\n\nmy_function <- function(x, y){ \n  write_csv(x, y)\n}\n\nmapply(my_function, ldf, files_out) \n\n\n\nNotice that we don’t need to initialize a list to store output, or keep track of indices. The emphasis is on the transformation taking place, not index bookkeeping, and setting up looping patterns. The result is the same, and we have a much clearer way to approach the problem.\n\nmap()\nThe map family of functions in the {purrr} package improves on base R’s apply functions with simplified syntax, type-specific output that makes it harder to accidentally create errors, and convenience functions for common operations. When we combine map() with pipes (%>%) we can greatly simplify our code.\nFirst, to mimic what we did with lapply() above:\n\n\n# read\nl <- map(files_in, ~read_csv(.x))\n\n# bind and split by SITE_CODE\nldf <- bind_rows(l)\nldf <- group_split(ldf, SITE_CODE)\n\n# write\nwalk2(ldf, files_out, ~write_csv(.x, .y)) \n\n\n\nThe .x signifies each of the individual elements of passed into the function, and can be thought of as a placeholder for the input. We begin read_csv() with a ~ to indicate the beginning of a function.\nWe can further simplify our code with map_df() to automatically row bind the list elements into one dataframe. Moreover, we can pipe these statements together to avoid creating the intermediate ldf object.\n\n\n# read and bind, split, and write\nmap_df(files_in, ~read_csv(.x)) %>% \n  group_split(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  walk2(files_out, ~write_csv(.x, .y))\n\n\n\nLet’s break down what we did above.\nWe mapped the function read_csv() over the vector of file paths, files_in. Although this function is simple, in practice we can map a large and complex function in the same way. The _df in map_df() means we pass the list otherwise returned by map() into bind_rows(), and thus return one combined dataframe of all the csv files we read instead of a list of dataframes.\nWe used group_split() to split the combined dataframe by SITE_CODE which returns a list of dataframes ordered by the unique values of the grouping variable. This is identical to base R’s split() except it doesn’t return a named list.\nWe walk2()ed over the list of dataframes (one for each SITE_CODE), and the files_out vector from above, and wrote a csv for each pair of objects (.x = dataframe and .y = output file path).\n\nExtra information\n\nWhat would happen if we used map2() instead of walk2() in the code above?\n\nClick for the Answer!\n\nwalk2() is a special case of walk() which takes 2 vector inputs instead of 1. The first and second vector inputs are called in the function with .x and .y like so: walk2(input_1, input_2, ~function(.x, .y)). We use walk() instead of map() whenever we want the side effect of the function, like writing a file. We could also use map() here, but it would unnecessarily print each of the 723 dataframes.\nYou may now we wondering if there is a map3(), map4() and so on. To map over more than 2 inputs at once, check out the “parallel” map purrr::pmap() function, which is similar to base R’s mapply().\n\n\n\nYou may notice that we used an intermediate object (files_out) from above. We could re-write our chain without this object by creating it within the function call:\n\n\n# read, bind, and write\nmap_df(files_in, ~read_csv(.x)) %>% \n  group_split(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  walk(\n    ~write_csv(\n      .x, \n      paste0(here(\"data\",\"gwl\",\"site_code\"), \"/\", .x$SITE_CODE[1], \".csv\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\nThe ~, .x, and .y syntax may seem confusing at first, but with some practice it will become easier, and it provides a consistent syntax to express complex ideas about your code. More more importantly, the emphasis is on keeping track of functions rather than creating and managing the scaffolding of for loops.\nTaking things one step further, imagine you were:\nonly interested in WELL_USE types equal to “Observation”\nyou needed to convert the WELL_DEPTH from feet to meters\nyou needed to output the data as three shapefiles, one for each county\nWe could capture these transform steps in a function, store it in our /functions folder as described in the project management module, and in this way, clean up our workspace so we can keep track of the functions applied on our data and keep our scripts short and readable.\nStore this in a file /functions/f_import_clean.R:\n\n\n# import dataframe, filter to observation wells, convert well \n# depth feet to meters, project to epgs 3310, & export the data\nf_import_clean_export <- function(file_in, file_out){\n  read_csv(file_in) %>% \n    filter(WELL_USE == \"Observation\") %>% \n    mutate(well_depth_m = WELL_DEPTH * 0.3048) %>% \n    sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"LONGITUDE\", \"LATITUDE\"), crs = 4269) %>% \n    sf::st_transform(3310) %>% \n    sf::st_write(file_out, delete_layer = TRUE)\n}\n\n\n\nNow we can walk() inputs over this function with ease in our main script without keeping track of loops and indices, or even the function internals, which are neatly stored in their own file.\n\n\nsource(here(\"functions\", \"f_import_clean_export.R\"))\n\n# create a directory to store results\ndir.create(here(\"results\"))\n\n# vectors with function args: input (.x) & output (.y) files\nfiles_in  <- list.files(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"county\"), full.names = TRUE)\nfiles_out <- here(\"results\", str_replace_all(basename(files_in), \".csv\", \".shp\"))\n\nwalk2(files_in, files_out, ~f_import_clean_export(.x, .y))\n\n\n\nNow we check the /results directory to verify it is populated with the shapefiles we just wrote.\n\nAdditional Resources\nIteration is a core skill that will allow you to scale your workflows from small to large while maintaining reproducibility. Combined with a proficiency in functional programming, you will more easily develop and store functions, declutter your workspace to focus on important transformations, streamline tracking down and fixing bugs, and keep track of data pipelines. Your ability to perform and re-perform arbitrarily complex workflows will exponentially increase.\nWe recommend the following places to start to learn more about functional programming in R:\nR for Data Science book section on Programming\nA talk about functional programming by Hadley Wickham\nAdvanced R book chapter on Functional programming\n\nLesson adapted from R for Data Science.\n\n\nPrevious module:5.

In other words, it is created and used but doesn’t exist in the Gobal Environment as a function you can call by name. The benefit of using anonymous functions is that they allow you to quickly write single-use functions without storing and managing them. For example, in the expression lapply(1:5, function(x) print(x)), the anonymous function is function(x) print(x). To make it a regular, named function, we assign it to a value, like print_value <- function(x) print(x). Then it can be called by name like so: lapply(1:5, print_value).↩︎\n",

Communicating the results of your analyses, or ability to make data “speak”, is of utmost importance. The modern day open source package ecosystem is full of powerful ways to give voice to our analyses.\nAnalyses typically lead to figures, tables, and interpretation of these information. The {rmarkdown} package provides R users with a standardized approach for turning R analyses into reports, documents, presentations, dashboards, and websites. In this module, we assume familiarity with {rmarkdown}, and extend the previous modules on iteration, functional programming, and reproducible workflows to demonstrate how to iterate over reports.\n\nReview the introduction to {rmarkdown} if needed.\nAccording to R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, some example use cases for creating a parameterized report include:\nShowing results for a specific geographic location.\nRunning a report that covers a specific time period.\nRunning a single analysis multiple times for different assumptions.\nControlling the behavior of knitr (e.g., specify if you want the code to be displayed or not).\nIn this module, we will focus on the first case, and build parameterized reports for a set of geographic locations. Throughout this course, we’ve been working with groundwater elevation data across California counties. Let’s imagine that we want to generate a report on groundwater level trends for a set of counties.\nAlthough the RStudio Interactive Development Environment (IDE) encourages knitting RMarkdown documents by clicking a button, we can also knit documents via: rmarkdown::render(). Iterating over render() is the key to scaling parameterized reports. To iterate over R Markdown reports, we must first understand how to use params.\n\n\n\n\nparams\nA parameterized .Rmd file takes a set of params (short for “parameters”) in the YAML header, which are bound into a named list called params and accessed with code from within the .Rmd file with params$<paramater-name>. For example, consider the example YAML:\ntitle: \"My awesome paramaterized report\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  start_date: 2021-01-01\n  watershed: Yuba\n  data: gwl_yuba.csv\nIn the code, we could then access the value \"2021-01-01\" with params$start_date. Similarly, params$watershed will equal \"Yuba\" and params$data will equal \"gwl_yuba.csv\".\n\nSet up a report with params\nLet’s apply params to our task and generate an html_document for a set of counties. To illustrate, we will use a simplified, pre-processed dataset of 3 counties (Sacramento, Yolo, and San Joaquin counties). If you’re motivated to do so, you can use the entire groundwater level dataset of > 2 million records to scale the process to all counties. Read in the data and take a look at the fields.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# groundwater level data for Sacramento, Yolo, San Joaquin counties\ngwl <- read_rds(here(\"data\", \"sac_yolo_sj.rds\"))\n\ngwl %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  slice(1) %>% \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nWe will iterate over the COUNTY_NAME to create three reports, one for each county. Copy and paste the following code into a new file reports/gwl_report.Rmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"`r paste(params$county, 'Groundwater Levels')`\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  county: \"placeholder\"\n---\n\n<br>\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(mapview)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(DT)\nmapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = \"100%\")\n\n# filter all groundwater level data (already loaded into memory) by \n# the supplied county\nd <- filter(gwl, COUNTY_NAME == params$county)\n\n# extract the county spatial file\ncounty_sf <- st_as_sf(map(\"county\", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) %>% \n  filter(ID == paste0(\"california,\", tolower(params$county)))\n\n```\n\n\nThis report shows groundwater levels in `r params$county` county.\n\nDates range from `r min(d$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(d$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)`.\n\nData source: [DWR Periodic Groundwater Level Database](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/periodic-groundwater-level-measurements).\n\n<br>\n\n## Distribution of measurements over time\n\n50% of measured values occur on or after `r median(d$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)`.\n\n```{r hist, echo = FALSE}\nd %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(MSMT_DATE)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"\", x = \"\", y = \"Count\")\n```\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Monitoring sites\n\n```{r map, echo = FALSE}\n# mapview of county outline\ncounty_mv <- mapview(\n  county_sf, layer.name = paste(params$county, \"county\"), \n  lwd = 2, color = \"red\", alpha.regions = 0\n)\n\n# mapview of monitoring points\npoints_mv <- d %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  slice(1) %>% \n  select(-MSMT_DATE) %>% # remove msmt date b/c its irrelevant\n  mapview(layer.name = \"Monitoring stations\")\n\ncounty_mv + points_mv\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## All groundwater levels\n\n```{r plot, echo = FALSE}\n# interactive hydrograph\np <- ggplot(d, aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE, color = SITE_CODE)) + \n  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +\n  guides(color = FALSE)\nplotly::ggplotly(p)\n```\n\n<br> \n\n```{r dt, echo = FALSE}\n# data table of median groundwater level per site, per year\nd %>% \n  select(-c(\"COUNTY_NAME\", \"WELL_DEPTH\")) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>% \n  mutate(YEAR = lubridate::year(MSMT_DATE)) %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE, YEAR) %>% \n  summarise(WSE_MEDIAN = median(WSE, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  DT::datatable(\n    extensions = 'Buttons', options = list(\n      dom = 'Bfrtip',\n      buttons = \n        list('copy', 'print', list(\n          extend  = 'collection',\n          buttons = c('csv', 'excel', 'pdf'),\n          text    = 'Download'\n        ))\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n\n***\n\nReport generated on `r Sys.Date()`.\n\n\nPause and think\nTake a moment to read the .Rmd file above and see what it does. Notice where params$county is located in the document. Particularly, in the first code chunk it’s used to filter the groundwater level data (assumed to be in memory so we only load it once rather than every time we run this script) down to the county parameter.\nd <- filter(gwl, COUNTY_NAME == params$county)\nNext, how might you write an .Rmd file like the one above and test that everything looks the way you want it to before calling it done? In other words, would you start by writing params$county in all places it needs to be or start with one county, make sure everything works, and then substitute in params$county?\n\n\nIterate over a report\nFinally, we create a vector of counties we want to write reports for and iterate over them. We also need to specify the output location of each file. Since we are writing html_documents, the file extension is .html. Using walk2() from our functional programming toolkit, we can pass in the counties vector and the output file paths into rmarkdown::render() and silently write the files.\n\n\n# unique counties to write reports for\ncounties  <- unique(gwl$COUNTY_NAME)\n\n# output file names\nfiles_out <- tolower(counties) %>% \n  str_replace_all(\" \", \"_\") %>% \n  paste0(., \".html\")\n\n# silently (walk) over the county names and file names, \n# creating a report for each combination\nwalk2(\n  counties, \n  files_out,\n  ~rmarkdown::render(\n    input       = here(\"reports\", \"gwl_report.Rmd\"), \n    output_file = here(\"reports\", .y),\n    params      = list(county = .x)\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nOpen and explore each of the files that were written.\n\n\nPause and think\nIf we wanted to automate reports like this and have them published online or emailed to our team every morning at 7AM, what tools would we need?\nHint: see the automation module section on task schedulers.\n\n\nIn-line R\nWithin an .Rmd we can insert R code in-line using the following syntax:\n\n\n`r <function>`\n\n\n\nSo for instance we can write a string like:\n\nThe mean of 1 and 3 is `r mean(c(1,3))`.\n\nAnd when the document knits, we get: The mean of 1 and 3 is 2.\nConsider this as an approach to add specific output about each site in the text narrative.\n\nAdditional Resources\nAlthough we only demonstrated one type of output report in this module, the html_document, there are many other output formats that you can parameterize and iterate over, including Word documents, PDFs, flexdashboards, and presentations.\n\nView some of the available R Markdown output formats here.\nTo dig deeper, see the official RMarkdown guide for paramaterized reports.\n\n\nPrevious module:6.

R and packages are your tools, and an RProject is your toolshed.\n\nREVIEW\n\nAlthough this is an intermediate level course, we will revisit introductory material on “Project Management” because no matter your skill level in R, strategic project management remains fundamental. Subsequent modules in this course assume familiarity with {here}, .Rprojects, naming conventions, and general best practices.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing core introductory topics, we will discuss .RProfile and .Renviron files and when to use them. To review core best practices we recommend particular familiarity with the following concepts:\nFilenaming\nRelative filepaths and the {here} package\nBest practices for project organization\n\n.RProfile\nIf you have user- or project-level code that needs to be run every time you start up R, customizing your .RProfile can streamline this operation.\nThe .RProfile file is an actual (hidden) file that is automatically sourced (run) as R code when you open an R session. A .RProfile file can live in the project root directory, or the user’s home directory, although only one .RProfile can be loaded per R session or RProject. If a project-level .Rprofile exists, it supersedes the user-level .Rprofile.\nYou can also “show hidden files” (instructions for Mac and PC) and edit .RProfile in a text editor. You can also do so in R with file.edit(\"~/.RProfile\").\nGlobal (user-level) .Rprofile\nThe easiest and most consistent way to edit your .RProfile file across operating systems is with the {usethis} package. Run usethis::edit_r_profile() to open your user-level (or global) .RProfile. This is the default .Rprofile that will be used for any and all projects unless you have a local (project-level) .Rprofile.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\n\n\nLocal (project-level) .Rprofile\nWe can create or edit a local or project-level .RProfile with the scope argument inside the edit_r_profile function. Remember, a project-level .RProfile will supersede the global .Rprofile.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile(scope = \"project\")\n\n\n\n\nUsing .Rprofile\nTo illustrate how .RProfile works, let’s do something cool and useless. We’ll write a short program that greets us with a random inspirational quote, and then we’ll put in .RProfile so it runs whenever we start up R.\nThe {cowsay} package is a fun way to print text animal art.\n\n\ncowsay::say(what = \"hello world!\", by = \"cow\")\n\n\n\n ----- \nhello world! \n ------ \n    \\   ^__^ \n     \\  (oo)\\ ________ \n        (__)\\         )\\ /\\ \n             ||------w|\n             ||      ||\n\nLet’s randomize the animal displayed and make the message it says one of the motivational quotes found at this Github repo, copy and paste the code into our .RProfile, and restart R.\n\n\nlibrary(cowsay) # animals!\nlibrary(glue)   # pasting things together\n\n# get vector of all animals\nanimals <- names(cowsay::animals)\n\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n\n# get dataframe of inspirational quotes\nquotes  <- readr::read_csv(glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\"))  \n\n# make full quote\nquotes$full_quote  <- glue(\"{quotes$Quote} - {quotes$Author}\")\n\n# now use it!\ncowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n\n\n\n ----- \nAutumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower. - Albert Camus \n ------ \n    \\   \n     \\\n  ><((((º>  ><((((º>  ><((((º>  ><((((º>  ><((((º>\n      Kiyoko Gotanda\n    \n\nrm(animals, quotes) # remove the objects we just created\n\n\n\n\n.Renviron\nSometimes you need to store sensitive information, like API Keys, Database passwords, data storage paths, or general variables used across all scripts. We don’t want to accidentally share these information, accidentally push them to Github, or copy and paste them over and over again from script to script. We also might want to build a codebase that relies on a few variables that another user can set in their own system in a way that works for them. Environmental variables are the way to address all of these concerns.\nEnvironmental variables are objects that store character strings. They are accessible from within R upon startup. To view all environmental variables, use Sys.getenv(). You can also pull out one environmental variable at a time by passing in its name, for instance:\n\n\nSys.getenv(\"USER\")\n\n\n[1] \"rapeek\"\n\nYou can set your own environmental variables which are stored in another hidden file called .Renviron (this is the Python analog of .env). Keep in mind, .Renviron files typically contain lists of environmental variables that look similar to R code but it is actually not running R code…so don’t put R code in your .Renviron file! If we need to run R code when starting up R, we use .RProfile.\nTo illustrate the use of .Renviron, we run usethis::edit_r_environ(), add the environmental variable ANIMAL = \"cat\", save, and restart R.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n\n\n\nWe can access our environmental variable as follows (remember you need to restart R for changes to take effect, try Session > Restart R):\n\n\nSys.getenv(\"ANIMAL\")\n\n\n\nWe can use our environmental variable, for instance, in a function.\n\n\ninspire_me <- function(animal){\n\n  # get pieces to make link\n  repo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\n  csv  <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n  \n  # silently read dataframe\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- readr::read_csv(\n      glue::glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")\n    )  \n  )\n  \n  # paste together the full quote\n  quotes$full_quote  <- paste0(quotes$Quote, \" -\", quotes$Author)\n  \n  # make a user-specified animal say the quote\n  cowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = animal)\n\n}\n\n# have the environmental variable say a quote\ninspire_me(Sys.getenv(\"ANIMAL\"))\n\n\n\nAlthough it may not appear powerful in this trivial example, when a project grows substantially large and complex, or when managing multiple sensitive passwords and access tokens, environmental variables are a standard approach that are widely used.\nImportant note, both these files .Renviron and .Rprofile need to end with a blank newline at the end. If this isn’t present, the last line of the file is ignored, and there isn’t a message or error associated with this. The usethis functions typically take care of this for you, but be aware of it just in case!\n\nPause and think\n\nIn the example function above, we might notice that reading in a url from a csv every time we run inspire_me() is a lot of unnecessary overhead. Where else might we be able to read that csv in automatically when R starts up, so that it’s available for our inspire_me() function, and that we only need to read it once?\n\n\nClick for Answers!\n\nWe can move read step of the csv into a project-level RProfile, so it’s available to the project where we need this csv, but not to any general R session we may open outside of the project.\n.RProfile\n\n\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv  <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\n\n# silently read dataframe\nsuppressMessages(\n  quotes  <- readr::read_csv(\n    glue::glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")\n  )  \n)\n\n# paste together the full quote\nquotes$full_quote  <- paste0(quotes$Quote, \" -\", quotes$Author)\n\n\n\nModified function\n\n\ninspire_me <- function(animal){\n\n  # make a user-specified animal say the quote\n  cowsay::say(sample(quotes$full_quote, 1), by = animal)\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies to organize projects/code\nBest practices for writing code across languages typically recommend package imports and function definitions at the top of a script, followed by code. For example, a script may look like this:\n\n\n# import packages\nlibrary(package_1)\nlibrary(package_2)\n\n# define functions\nmy_first_function <- function(){\n  print(\"hello\")\n}\n\nmy_second_function <- function(){\n  print(\"world\")\n}\n\n# run code/functions\nmy_first_function()\nmy_second_function()\n\n\n\nThese approaches work well when scripts are relatively simple, but as a project grows large and complex, it’s best practice to move functions into another script or set of scripts, and break up your workflow into discrete steps.\nFor instance, although the inspire_me() function above is relatively simple, we can pretend that the read, transform, and print steps carried out in the function were themselves long functions in part of a much more complex, real-world workflow. Imagine we created a script called functions.R that contained the following code. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen purrr::walk() before. We’ll cover this in a later module on iteration, and all you need to know about it now is that it “walks” over each input and applies a function. In this case, we apply the require() function to a vector of package names to load them.\nNotice that all functions start with f_. This prefix makes it easy to read in a script and takes advantage of auto-complete.\n\n\n# list packages in a vector and load them all\npkgs <- c(\"readr\", \"cowsay\")\npurrr::walk(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\n# read quotes from a url\nf_read_data <- function(url){\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- read_csv(url)  \n  )\n  return(quotes)\n}\n\n# paste the quote to the author\nf_preprocess_data <- function(d){\n  d$full_quote  <- paste0(d$Quote, \" -\", d$Author)\n  return(d)\n}\n\n# print a random animal and a random quote\nf_inspire_me <- function(d){\n  animals <- names(animals)\n  say(sample(d$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n}\n\n\n\nWe can call this script using source() to load or import these functions into our environment where they are available for use, just as we load a library.\n\n\nsource(here(\"functions.R\"))\n\n\n\nAbstracting Functions from Code\nHowever, this is hardly a satisfying solution because in a real project, our pretend functions above may grow quite large, and we will likely add more and more functions. Eventually, a single script may hold them all, and something like functions.R may become many hundreds of lines long, making it difficult to sift through, debug, or add new lines of code. A better organizational approach which makes things easier to maintain over time is to move all our functions to a directory /functions, and store them all as separate files named after their function name:\nA good rule of thumb to follow is to try and keep scripts less than 150 lines in length. When scripts approach this length, they become difficult to keep track of, and there were likely missed opportunities to refactor the script into separate functions and modules.\nSave as /functions/f_read_data.R\n\n\n# read quotes from a url\nf_read_data <- function(url){\n  suppressMessages(\n    quotes  <- read_csv(url)\n  )\n  return(quotes)\n}\n\n\n\nSave as /functions/f_preprocess_data.R\n\n\n# paste the quote to the author\nf_preprocess_data <- function(d){\n  d$full_quote  <- paste0(d$Quote, \" -\", d$Author)\n  return(d)\n}\n\n\n\nSave as /functions/f_inspire_me.R\n\n\n# print a random animal and a random quote\nf_inspire_me <- function(d){\n  animals <- names(animals)\n  say(sample(d$full_quote, 1), by = sample(animals, 1))\n}\n\n\n\nThe functions folder in the root project directory should now look like this:\n\n\n\nNow in our /code directory, we create a script, 01_control.R to source our functions and use them. Be sure to restart R to clear your environment before sourcing this control script so we know we are working from a clean slate.\nSave as /code/01_control.R and run.\n\n\n# packages needed for this script\npkgs <- c(\"readr\", \"cowsay\", \"here\", \"tidyverse\", \"glue\")\nwalk(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\n# silently source all functions using the purrr::walk function\nfns <- list.files(here(\"functions\"), full.names = TRUE)\nwalk(fns, ~source(.x))\n\n# define the url where quotes are located\n# get pieces to make link\nrepo <- \"JakubPetriska/060958fd744ca34f099e947cd080b540\"\ncsv <- \"raw/963b5a9355f04741239407320ac973a6096cd7b6/quotes.csv\"\nurl <- glue(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{repo}/{csv}\")  \n\n# use all of our functions\nf_read_data(url) %>% \n  f_preprocess_data() %>% \n  f_inspire_me()\n\n\n\n\n\n ----- \nYou can't stop the waves, but you can \nlearn to surf. -Jon Kabat-Zinn \n ------ \n    \\   \n     \\\n                   ____\n                _.' :  `._\n            .-.'`.  ;   .'`.-.\n   __      / : ___\\ ;  /___ ; \\      __\n  ,'_ \"\"--.:__;\".-.\";: :\".-.\":__;.--\"\" _`,\n  :' `.t\"\"--..

In the example above, we were able to abstract functions into a separate folder which makes keeping track of them much easier than if they cluttered our control script.\nIt’s also a good rule of thumb to keep each line of code less than 75 characters long to ease readability.\n\nLearn more\n\nSeparating all functions into standalone scripts is not a revolutionary idea – in fact, this is precisely how R packages are written! For example, see the {dplyr} github repo’s /R folder which contains all dplyr functions in one directory. When you call library(dplyr) you’re essentially sourcing all of these functions into your environment.\n\n\nIf project management and reproducible data pipelines are interesting to you, check out the {targets} R package. A similar framework for Shiny Apps exists called {golem}, which also includes {usethis}-like commands that streamline common chores in Shiny App development.\n\n\n\n{renv}\nWe use {here} because we expect that whoever else opens your code on their machine is likely to have a different project root path, and {here} ensures your code is portable between different computers with different root project paths (e.g., ~/Documents/Github/myproject versus C:\\Users\\louis\\Documents\\myproject).\nDevelopment environments are similar. When we work in R – or any programming language for that matter – we use a snapshot of package versions based on when we downloaded and installed them [e.g. with install.packages()]. You can check the version of the installed packages loaded into your current environment with sessionInfo().\n\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\nR version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Big Sur 11.4\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib\nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods  \n[7] base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] glue_1.4.2   cowsay_0.8.0 purrr_0.3.4  knitr_1.33  \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] bslib_0.2.5.1     compiler_4.1.0    pillar_1.6.1     \n [4] jquerylib_0.1.4   highr_0.9         tools_4.1.0      \n [7] rmsfact_0.0.3     digest_0.6.27     downlit_0.2.1    \n[10] jsonlite_1.7.2    evaluate_0.14     lifecycle_1.0.0  \n[13] tibble_3.1.2      pkgconfig_2.0.3   png_0.1-7        \n[16] rlang_0.4.11      rstudioapi_0.13   cli_3.0.1        \n[19] curl_4.3.2        distill_1.2       yaml_2.2.1       \n[22] xfun_0.24         stringr_1.4.0     fs_1.5.0         \n[25] vctrs_0.3.8       sass_0.4.0        hms_1.1.0        \n[28] rprojroot_2.0.2   here_1.0.1        R6_2.5.0         \n[31] fansi_0.5.0       rmarkdown_2.9     readr_1.4.0      \n[34] magrittr_2.0.1    usethis_2.0.1     fortunes_1.5-4   \n[37] htmltools_0.5.1.1 ellipsis_0.3.2    utf8_1.2.1       \n[40] stringi_1.7.3     crayon_1.4.1     \n\nThe version number is the string of numbers listed after a package name and underscore.\nSimilarly, you can use installed.packages() to view information on all of your installed packages.\nWhen packages change between versions, changes are typically designed to fix bugs or improve performance, but sometimes, they can break code. Thus, collaborative work on a project may be challenged by people working on the same code but with different versions of packages.\nEven the version of R itself changes, although base R changes very slowly and the R Core Team tries to make new versions of R backwards-compatible to not break scripts written before potentially breaking changes.\nThe solution to this problem is for everyone to use the same versions of packages (and R), which is to say that collaborators should use the same development environment. This is a common concept across programming languages.\n{renv} manages your package environment and makes it easy to share it with others by creating and curating a “lock” file (renv.lock) in the root project directory. When starting a project, create the file with renv::init(), install packages as you go along, and update the lockfile with renv::snapshot(). When a collaborator opens your project (for example, after cloning it from Github), all they need to do is open the .RProj file and {renv} will automatically set up the development environment captured in the lock file.\nThe renv.lock file is a JSON file with information on the version of R and the versions of all packages used by the project.\nIf you find yourself needing to share important analyses, perhaps that run on a production server, you should look into {renv}. For most day-to-day data science that you don’t plan on sharing or working collaboratively on, it may be unnecessary.\n\n\nPrevious module: 2. Git Next module: 4. Interactive Visualization\n\n\n\n",

Special attention is paid to automation.\nAs you expand your ability to write R code, automation becomes possible. “Automation” can mean different things, but generally refers to the process of replacing time that you would spend on a workflow with a computer program, or an R script in the context of this course. The beauty of automation is that you can create workflows that would be nearly impossible to complete in a human lifetime, and run them thousands of times, all while you’re out on a coffee break. In some circles, this is sometimes jokingly referred to as, “making computers do your bidding.” Automation happens whenever you write a program that saves you time, freeing you to do other things.\nThe very act of writing an R script (or program) to perform analyses is automation, because you have automated the need to point and click through various tasks and type instructions at particular times, such as in a traditional point-and-click workflow.\nHowever, any R program you write still needs a human to run it, and perhaps you have not one, but a chain of 5 scripts that are evaluated sequentially to import, clean, model, visualize, and output data. Someone needs to run the program. Another step up the automation ladder is to wrap these 5 scripts in a single program that calls them all in sequence, like a master switch. Instead of running 5 scripts, now we only need to run 1.\nThere is still further automation potential. We can write another program to call the “master switch” at specified times, fully remove ourselves from the pipeline, and allow the program will run all on its own (although it may require maintenance from time to time).\n\nAny time we have a fully automated program that runs on its own, logging should be implemented. Logging allows us to monitor an automated process, and diagnose and quickly fix anything that went wrong.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Automation is like watering a row of plants. Each program is like a bucket that waters one plant at a time. Wrapping the programs into a single “master switch” control script is like installing drip irrigation so that all plants are watered at once. In order to fully automate, we can set a task scheduler, which is like adding a timer onto our drip irrigation system.\n\n\n\nWe should always strive for at least a degree of automation represented by the left-most figure, with a set of programs for each step in our workflow, and functions abstracted out of these programs1 to improve readability and project organization.\nWhether or not to write wrapper programs or configure task schedulers depends on the needs of the workflow. Guidance on when and when to not automate will be discussed in this module.\nTo demonstrate varying degrees of automation in a real-life example and extend our practice of functional programming, we will focus on a case study using the DWR’s Periodic Groundwater Level Database.\n\nCase Study: groundwater level trend analysis\nThe California Department of Water Resources publishes a routine report on groundwater level conditions that shows groundwater level trends on a point-by-point basis. Short-term (i.e., 1, 3, and 5 year) and long-term trends (i.e., 10 and 20 years) are displayed in the report.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The “California Groundwater Conditions Update - Spring 2020”, DWR (2020) demonstrates the rate and direction of groundwater level change over different time periods, shown here is the 20000-2020 trend.\n\n\n\nOur Task\nLet’s imagine our task is to assess change in groundwater level across all stations and plot it on a map, just as we see in the report. In the sections that follow we will calculate groundwater level change trends at representative monitoring points in the Periodic groundwater level database we have been using in this course, and demonstrate best practices in creating a reproducible, automatable pipeline.\nAlong the way, we will also cover key concepts including:\nconditional execution\nfunctional programming with nested lists\ntips for writing helpful functions\ntask scheduling\nlogging\nImport Data\nTo begin, let’s import data and join it. If your internet connection is slow, use: d <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"gwl_sac.csv\")) to skip the step below and read in a copy of the data from a github repository. If you want to see how to download this data, follow along with the code below2:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\n# urls for data\nbase_url <- \n  \"https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dd9b15f5-6d08-4d8c-bace-37dc761a9c08/resource/\"\nurls <- paste0(\n  base_url, \n  c(\"af157380-fb42-4abf-b72a-6f9f98868077/download/stations.csv\",\n    \"bfa9f262-24a1-45bd-8dc8-138bc8107266/download/measurements.csv\",\n    \"f1deaa6d-2cb5-4052-a73f-08a69f26b750/download/perforations.csv\")\n)\n\n# create directory and define paths to save downloaded files\ndir.create(here(\"data\", \"pgwl\"))\nfiles_out <- here(\"data\", \"pgwl\", basename(urls))\n\n# download files\nwalk2(urls, files_out, ~download.file(.x, .y))\n\n# read and combine - use datatable for speed and memory management\nd <- map(files_out, ~data.table::fread(.x)) %>% \n  reduce(left_join, by = \"SITE_CODE\")\n\n# d contains ~2.3 million observations: filter to Sacramento County\nd <- filter(d, COUNTY_NAME == \"Sacramento\")\n\n\n\n\nWe use copied URLs here, but for large, standardized websites you can use {rvest} and SelectorGadget to automate scraping URLs and other data. We also used purrr::reduce() to recursively left_join() a list of dataframes. This is a powerful concept, because the alternative is to manually left_join() each list element. Read up on ?reduce to learn more.\n\n\n\n\nMap/Visualize the Data\nNow that we have our Sacramento data in R either by downloading it with the code above or by reading it in directly with read_csv, let’s transform it to an sf object and plot just to sanity check that we’re indeed looking at Sacramento County groundwater levels.\n\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(mapview)\nmapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE) # setting to help render map\n\n# select only columns we will use in this analysis\nd <- d %>% \n  select(SITE_CODE, MSMT_DATE, WSE, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, WELL_DEPTH)\n\n# convert to sf object\nd <-

Trends in Data\nRecall that we want to assess change in groundwater level across all stations and plot it on a map. In other words, assume we have the linear model describing a set of groundwater elevations (\\(\\hat{Y}_i\\)), as a function of time (\\(X_i\\)), proportional to some unknown y-intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) and coefficient (\\(\\beta_1\\)) for a set of observations at times \\(i = 1, ..., n\\):\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(X_i) + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nTime alone is actually a poor predictor of groundwater level (and shouldn’t be interpreted in a strict statistical sense), but for our purposes, the linear model above is useful because the \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficient can be interpreted as the average groundwater level trend at a monitoring site over some time frame. If \\(\\beta_1 > 0\\), the average groundwater level is increasing, and if \\(\\beta_1 < 0\\), it is decreasing. The magnitude of \\(\\beta_1\\) tells us by how much the groundwater level is increasing or decreasing and can be plotted per monitoring site, and compared to other monitoring sites to understand the spatial distribution of groundwater level change in a region. In this example, our region of interest is Sacramento County, but in the spirit of automation, we will create a function that allows us to apply this workflow to any county, or even the entire state of California.\nTo apply a linear model to each monitoring site, we use the lm() function in base R. If we apply the function to our entire dataset, we end up with a linear model of all groundwater levels in Sacramento county:\n\n\nggplot(d) +\n  geom_line(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE, group = SITE_CODE), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s filter out that one outlier (groundwater levels don’t just spike by hundreds of feet so rapidly like that), filter the date range of the data to the last 20 years, and replot. We can see a slight negative groundwater level trend over the basin, but this spatial average may be skewed by monitoring stations with more data than others and increased data density in more recent years.\n\n\n# recent data without the obviously erroneous outlier\nd_recent <- filter(d, WSE >-200 & MSMT_DATE >= lubridate::ymd(\"2000-01-01\"))\n\nggplot(d_recent) +\n  geom_line(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE, group = SITE_CODE), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this isn’t quite what we need. What we need is a linear model for each and every one of the individual stations in this dataset. {ggplot2} is great for visualizing what we are looking for. For example, here are a few of the monitoring sites, each with a unique linear model, which can be viewed with facet_wrap().\n\n\nd_recent %>% \n  filter(SITE_CODE %in% unique(d$SITE_CODE)[1:7]) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~SITE_CODE)\n\n\n\n\nNow, it’s time to calculate those numbers with lm(). We will use {broom} to tidy up model results in a clean dataframe. Note that because the class of our MSMT_DATE column is \"POSIXct\", the units returned for our coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) will be in \\(ft/sec\\) rather than the more intuitive \\(ft/yr\\), thus we define a function to handle the conversion from \\(ft/sec\\) to \\(ft/yr\\). For the entire dataset the average annual change in groundwater level over the 20 year timeframe is:\n\n\n# convert from seconds to years\nsec_to_yr <- function(sec){\n  yr <- sec * 31557600\n  return(yr)\n}\n\n# create the linear model and view output\nm <- lm(WSE ~ MSMT_DATE, data = d_recent) \n\nm\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = WSE ~ MSMT_DATE, data = d_recent)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)    MSMT_DATE  \n  4.614e+01   -4.462e-08  \n\n# tidy the model output with broom and convert ft/sec to ft/yr\nbroom::tidy(m) %>% \n  slice(2) %>% \n  mutate(estimate_ft_yr = sec_to_yr(estimate))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 6\n  term         estimate   std.error statistic   p.value estimate_ft_yr\n  <chr>           <dbl>       <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>          <dbl>\n1 MSMT_DA…     -4.46e-8     1.92e-9     -23.3 1.75e-117          -1.41\n\nFrom above, we see that the average annual decline is -1.41 \\(ft/yr\\).\nNested Lists\nWe could turn this linear model call into a function and loop over it with a for loop, saving each model result in a list element. We could also map this function over a list of dataframes created by split(d, d$SITE_CODE) (or the tidyverse equivalent, group_split(d, SITE_CODE)), but there’s a better way with functional programming.\nWe will use nested lists, specifically with the tidyr::nest() function, which allows us to convert a dataframe grouped by some variable (in our case it will be SITE_CODE) into a dataframe with a column that “nests” the data for each unique grouping variable. For instance:\n\n\nl <- d_recent %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  nest() \nl\n\n\n# A tibble: 302 x 2\n# Groups:   SITE_CODE [302]\n   SITE_CODE          data          \n   <chr>              <list>        \n 1 384931N1212618W001 <sf [7 × 4]>  \n 2 384742N1213146W001 <sf [7 × 4]>  \n 3 384798N1212614W001 <sf [38 × 4]> \n 4 384532N1212856W001 <sf [18 × 4]> \n 5 384425N1213031W001 <sf [38 × 4]> \n 6 384260N1212853W001 <sf [19 × 4]> \n 7 384251N1213346W001 <sf [7 × 4]>  \n 8 384526N1211695W001 <sf [112 × 4]>\n 9 384511N1212360W001 <sf [19 × 4]> \n10 384252N1211997W001 <sf [9 × 4]>  \n# … with 292 more rows\n\nThe resulting dataframe has a number of rows equal to the length of unique values in the SITE_CODE column, and a column called data with nested dataframes, one for each SITE_CODE (grouping variable). Notice that in the data column above, each nested dataframe has 4 columns, but a differing number of rows (groundwater level observations). This makes sense because each monitoring station has the same number of fields, but a different number of samples. Let’s inspect the first dataframe:\n\n\nl$data[[1]]\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 7 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -121.262 ymin: 38.4931 xmax: -121.262 ymax: 38.4931\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n# A tibble: 7 x 4\n  MSMT_DATE             WSE WELL_DEPTH           geometry\n  <dttm>              <dbl>      <dbl>        <POINT [°]>\n1 2004-03-01 00:00:00  -8.6        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n2 2003-10-01 00:00:00  -3.3        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n3 2003-03-15 00:00:00  -1.1        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n4 2002-10-01 00:00:00 -10.5        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n5 2001-10-01 00:00:00 -13          780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n6 2001-03-15 00:00:00   1.9        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n7 2000-03-15 00:00:00  -0.2        780 (-121.262 38.4931)\n\nWith nested data, we we can mutate new columns on the dataframe based onto the nested data column by mapping over each dataframe. For instance, we can add a linear model:\n\n\nd_recent %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  # nest the data per SITE_CODE grouping variable\n  nest() %>% \n  mutate(\n    # map a linear model onto the data\n    model = map(data, ~lm(WSE ~ MSMT_DATE, data = .x))\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 302 x 3\n# Groups:   SITE_CODE [302]\n   SITE_CODE          data           model \n   <chr>              <list>         <list>\n 1 384931N1212618W001 <sf [7 × 4]>   <lm>  \n 2 384742N1213146W001 <sf [7 × 4]>   <lm>  \n 3 384798N1212614W001 <sf [38 × 4]>  <lm>  \n 4 384532N1212856W001 <sf [18 × 4]>  <lm>  \n 5 384425N1213031W001 <sf [38 × 4]>  <lm>  \n 6 384260N1212853W001 <sf [19 × 4]>  <lm>  \n 7 384251N1213346W001 <sf [7 × 4]>   <lm>  \n 8 384526N1211695W001 <sf [112 × 4]> <lm>  \n 9 384511N1212360W001 <sf [19 × 4]>  <lm>  \n10 384252N1211997W001 <sf [9 × 4]>   <lm>  \n# … with 292 more rows\n\nNow we have a linear model output object per SITE_CODE, but let’s not stop there. Let’s also mutate new columns with the intercept (\\(\\beta_1\\)), the direction and magnitude of the intercept, convert units to \\(ft/yr\\), and unnest() the data.\n\n\nd_recent <- d_recent %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  # nest the data per SITE_CODE grouping variable\n  nest() %>% \n  mutate(\n    # map a linear model across data, extract slope magnitude & direction\n    model     = map(data, ~lm(WSE ~ MSMT_DATE, data = .x)),\n    b1        = map(model, ~coefficients(.x)[[\"MSMT_DATE\"]]),\n    b1        = map(b1, ~sec_to_yr(.x)),\n    direction = map(b1, ~ifelse(.x >= 0, \"increase\", \"decline\")),\n    # duration of the data in units of years so we know how the period\n    # over which the linear model is estimated\n    length_yr = map(data, ~as.numeric(diff(range(.x$MSMT_DATE))) / 365)\n  ) %>% \n  # unnest all columns so we can access values\n  unnest(c(data, b1:length_yr)) %>% \n  select(-model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to View(d_recent) and inspect the new columns.\nNow we can visualize trends for each station like before. Note that not all records are a full 20 years long!\n\n\nd_recent %>% \n  filter(SITE_CODE %in% unique(d$SITE_CODE)[1:7]) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE, color = direction), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~SITE_CODE) +\n  labs(color = \"Trend\")\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget that these trends have a spatial component. Let’s now only visualize sites with a duration_yr of 5 years or more.\n\n\n# slice the first observation per SITE_ID (for location) and \n# re-convert to sf which is lost during nest and unnest\nd_map <- d_recent %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  slice(1) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  st_as_sf() %>% \n  filter(length_yr >= 5)\n\n# create a bin for trend magnitude that matches DWR bins (Fig 2)\nd_map$bin <- cut(\n  d_map$b1, \n  breaks = c(-1000, -2.5, 0, 2.5, 1000), \n  labels = c(\"Increase > 2.5 ft/yr\", \"Increase 0 - 2.5 ft/yr\", \n             \"Decrease 0 - 2.5f ft/yr\", \"Decrease > 2.5 ft/yr\")\n)\n  \n# sacramento county polygon\nsac <- st_read(here(\"data\", \"shp\", \"sac\", \"sac_county.shp\")) %>% \n  st_transform(st_crs(d_map))\n\n\nReading layer `sac_county' from data source \n  `/Users/rapeek/Documents/github/r4wrds/intermediate/data/shp/sac/sac_county.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 9 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -13565710 ymin: 4582007 xmax: -13472670 ymax: 4683976\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator\n\n# plot direction\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = sac) +\n  geom_sf(data = d_map, aes(fill = direction), pch = 21, size = 2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(fill = \"Groundwater trend\")\n\n\n\n# plot magnitude bins\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = sac) +\n  geom_sf(data = d_map, aes(color = bin), size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  rcartocolor::scale_color_carto_d(\"Groundwater trend\", palette = \"TealRose\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nThe map above suggest there are only 3 locations in the basin that show an absolute change of more than 2.5 \\(ft/yr\\). Most of the longer term monitoring locations have an annual absolute rate of change within 0-2.5 \\(ft/yr\\). A quick comparison with Figure 2 suggests that our calculated groundwater level trends are similar in magnitude.\nHow to write helpful functions\nEverything we’ve done until this point is valuable, but is it reproducible? In the sense that we can re-run these scripts on new data, yes, but we can apply project management best practices and refactor our code into functions and programs (scripts) that are easy to re-run (Figure 1, left-most situation). We can go one step further and wrap everything into a control script (Figure 1, center situation), and in the next section, we’ll discuss how to fully automate (Figure 1, right-most situation).\nIn the spirit of “don’t repeat yourself” (DRY), it’s often said:\n\nIf you copy paste a workflow more than 3 times, write a function.\n\nRecall that in this case study, we want to reevaluate groundwater level trends twice per year, once in spring and once in fall. We decide to save time in the future by abstracting these tasks into a set of functions and a central control script. We also know that others will need to use this same workflow, so we strive to turn our analysis into a reproducible tool for others and include helpful messaging, errors, and conditional execution (i.e., if statements) in the code.\n1. Download\nLet’s begin with the download step. Save this as functions/f_wcr_download.R. Notice that we add a dir_out argument that allows a user to specify a directory to save files to. If this path doesn’t exist, we create it. Also, we allow users to specify the urls, so if case they change in the future, this function need not change.\n\n\n# download wcr data\nf_wcr_download <- function(dir_out, urls){\n\n  # create directory and define paths to save downloaded files\n  if(! dir.exists(dir_out)){ \n    dir.create(dir_out) \n  }\n  \n  # output file paths\n  files_out <- file.path(dir_out, basename(urls))\n  \n  # download files\n  walk2(urls, files_out, ~download.file(.x, .y))\n  \n}\n\n\n\n2. Read\nNext, the import function should be saved as functions/f_wcr_import.R. Let’s design it so that the user provides a county and a vector of input files. The function returns a helpful message in case they don’t provide a valid county. Along the way, we also provide helpful messages with cat() statements that print messages to the terminal as the function moves along. Messages like this are can be considered rudimentary form of logging which provides a user information on the status of a function, and may help diagnose and fix errors that may arise by showing the last place where a successful cat() message printed.\n\n🐈 cat() stands for “concatenate and print”. It takes any number of objects, concatenates them with a space in-between, and prints them to the console. In the function below, we add \"/n\" (newlines) to each cat() call so that the next cat() message begins on a new line in the console.\n\n\n# import downloaded wcr data\nf_wcr_import <- function(county, files_in){\n  # valid counties from entire dataset, i.e.,\n  # dput(sort(unique(d$COUNTY_NAME)))\n  counties_valid <-\n    c(\"Alameda\", \"Alpine\", \"Amador\", \"Butte\", \"Calaveras\", \"Colusa\",\n      \"Contra Costa\", \"Del Norte\", \"El Dorado\", \"Fresno\", \"Glenn\",\n      \"Humboldt\", \"Imperial\", \"Inyo\", \"Kern\", \"Kings\", \"Klamath, OR\",\n      \"Lake\", \"Lassen\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Madera\", \"Marin\", \"Mariposa\",\n      \"Mendocino\", \"Merced\", \"Modoc\", \"Mono\", \"Monterey\", \"Napa\", \"Nevada\",\n      \"Orange\", \"Placer\", \"Plumas\", \"Riverside\", \"Sacramento\", \"San Benito\",\n      \"San Bernardino\", \"San Diego\", \"San Francisco\", \"San Joaquin\",\n      \"San Luis Obispo\", \"San Mateo\", \"Santa Barbara\", \"Santa Clara\",\n      \"Santa Cruz\", \"Shasta\", \"Sierra\", \"Siskiyou\", \"Solano\", \"Sonoma\",\n      \"Stanislaus\", \"Sutter\", \"Tehama\", \"Tulare\", \"Tuolumne\", \"Ventura\",\n      \"Yolo\", \"Yuba\", \"ALL\")\n\n  # ensure input county is valid before reading in data\n  if(! county %in% counties_valid) {\n    stop(\n      glue(\"County must be one of: {paste(counties_valid, collapse = ', ')}\"),\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n  }\n\n  cat(\"Valid county provided, now proceeding to read data...\", \"\\n\")\n\n  # read and combine - use datatable for speed and memory management\n  d <- map(files_in, ~data.table::fread(.x)) %>%\n    reduce(left_join, by = \"SITE_CODE\")\n\n  cat(\"Files read and combined...\", \"\\n\")\n\n  # if a county is supplied (not requesting ALL the data), filter to it\n  if(county != \"ALL\"){\n    cat(\"Filtering to\", county, \"county...\", \"\\n\")\n    d <- filter(d, COUNTY_NAME == county)\n  }\n\n  # select only relevant columns & convert to sf object\n  cat(\"Selecting relevant columns...\", \"\\n\")\n  d <- d %>%\n    select(SITE_CODE, MSMT_DATE, WSE, LONGITUDE, \n           LATITUDE, WELL_DEPTH, COUNTY_NAME) %>%\n    filter(!is.na(LONGITUDE) & !is.na(LATITUDE)) %>%\n    st_as_sf(coords = c(\"LONGITUDE\", \"LATITUDE\"), crs = 4269)\n\n  cat(\"Data import complete.\", \"\\n\")\n  return(d)\n}\n\n\n\nNotice the use of conditional execution (if() statements that check if certain criteria apply before proceeding), coupled with stop() functions that terminate the function call. It doesn’t make sense to read in an entire dataframe and filter by a county name character sting that’s not present in the data, so we check for that condition before proceeding and provide a helpful error message in case the user enters an incorrect county. We added a valid county called “ALL” which if passed to the function, doesn’t filter the data to a county, and instead returns the entire dataset. All throughout, we added helpful cat() messages so that as this function is chugging along, messages are printed to the console to let us know what’s happening under the hood. This also helps with debugging and logging (as we will discuss later).\nTo verify our function works as expected, let’s trigger an error message by asking it to return groundwater levels from a county that doesn’t exist in the vector of valid counties.\n\n\nf_wcr_import(county = \"Tatooine\")\n\n\n\nError: County must be one of: Alameda, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa,\nContra Costa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Fresno, Glenn, Humboldt, Imperial, Inyo, \nKern, Kings, Klamath, OR, Lake, Lassen, Los Angeles, Madera, Marin, Mariposa, \nMendocino, Merced, Modoc, Mono, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Placer, Plumas, \nRiverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, \nSan Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz,\nShasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Tulare, \nTuolumne, Ventura, Yolo, Yuba, ALL\n3. Clean\nNext, we need to clean our data. You can imagine a much more extensive cleaning process for another dataset, but in our simple example, all we want to do is provide the user with the option to set a start and end time to filter the data by. If a start or end date is not provided, we have the function calculate the min and max date and use those.\nSave the following code as functions/f_wcr_clean.R:\n\n\n# clean wcr data\nf_wcr_clean <- function(df, start_date = NULL, end_date = NULL){\n\n  cat(\"Cleaning data\", \"\\n\")\n\n  # if start and end date are NULL, use the min and max date\n  if(is.null(start_date)){\n    start_date <- min(df$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)\n    cat(\"Start date NULL, using min date:\", as.character(start_date), \"\\n\")\n  }\n  if(is.null(end_date)){\n    end_date <- max(df$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)\n    cat(\"End date NULL, using max date:\", as.character(end_date), \"\\n\")\n  }\n\n  # filter to date range and clean\n  df <- filter(df, MSMT_DATE >= start_date & MSMT_DATE <= end_date)\n\n  cat(\n    \"Data filtered between\",\n    as.character(start_date), \"and\",\n    as.character(end_date),   \"\\n \"\n  )\n\n  return(df)\n}\n\n\n\nNotice that about half of this function is focused not on the transformation, but rather, setting the min and max dates if they’re not provided.\nchecking that the correct object classes are passed into the function, and sensibly imputing argument values if they’re not provided by the user (i.e., if not provided as arguments, start and end dates are assigned as the min and max dates).\nThe actual filter() statement only takes 1 line of code. The amount of time you should spend fine-tuning functions like so depends on how much you anticipate others using them, and how much you want to constrain their use and messaging. Not every project requires this level of detail.\n\nExtra practice: using stop()\n\nA useful function when writing functions is stop(), which stops a function from running, and prints an error message. When paired with if(), you can build functions that test for conditions where you want the function to error.\nFor example, in the function above f_wcr_clean(), you may notice that the function depends on a valid date object passed in as the second and third arguments, start_date and end_date.\nHow would you use if() and stop() to verify if the supplied start_date and end_date were indeed valid date objects?\n\n\nClick for the Answer!\n\nThe answer is to check the class of the supplied arguments. If they are not within an expected class of c(\"Date\", \"POSIXct\", \"POSIXt\"), then we can throw an error. Look up the stop() documentation (?stop) to see what the .call argument does.\n\n\n# clean wcr data\nf_wcr_clean <- function(df, start_date = NULL, end_date = NULL){\n\n  # valid date classes\n  valid_class <- c(\"Date\", \"POSIXct\", \"POSIXt\")\n\n  # verify correct date class\n  if(! is.null(start_date) & ! class(start_date)[1] %in% valid_class ){\n    stop(\n      glue(\n        \"Invalid `start_date` class, use: {paste(valid_class, collapse=', ')}\",\n      ),\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n  }\n  if(! is.null(end_date) & ! class(end_date)[1] %in% valid_class ){\n    stop(\n      glue(\n        \"Invalid `end_date` class, use: {paste(valid_class, collapse=', ')}\",\n      ),\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n  }\n\n  cat(\"Cleaning data\", \"\\n\")\n\n  # if start and end date are NULL, use the min and max date\n  if(is.null(start_date)){\n    start_date <- min(df$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)\n    cat(\"Start date NULL, using min date:\", as.character(start_date), \"\\n\")\n  }\n  if(is.null(end_date)){\n    end_date <- max(df$MSMT_DATE, na.rm = TRUE)\n    cat(\"End date NULL, using max date:\", as.character(end_date), \"\\n\")\n  }\n\n  # filter to date range and clean\n  df <- filter(df, MSMT_DATE >= start_date & MSMT_DATE <= end_date)\n\n  cat(\n    \"Data filtered between\",\n    as.character(start_date), \"and\",\n    as.character(end_date),   \"\\n \"\n  )\n\n  return(df)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Model\nMoving on, after cleaning, it’s time to model.

Write\nAnd finally, we want to save these data. We can write another function for that, but we can also achieve that pretty simply within the control script using functional programming, so we’ll do that.\nNow that we have functions defined, let’s define one control module to download, import and clean, model, visualize, and write. Save this as a new file code/00_control.R.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(pathwork)\n\n# load functions\nlist.files(here(\"functions\"), full.names = TRUE, pattern = \"f_wcr\") %>%\n  walk(~source(.x))\n\n# urls for data\nbase_url <-\n  \"https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dd9b15f5-6d08-4d8c-bace-37dc761a9c08/resource/\"\nurls <- paste0(\n  base_url,\n  c(\"af157380-fb42-4abf-b72a-6f9f98868077/download/stations.csv\",\n    \"bfa9f262-24a1-45bd-8dc8-138bc8107266/download/measurements.csv\",\n    \"f1deaa6d-2cb5-4052-a73f-08a69f26b750/download/perforations.csv\")\n)\n\n# data path to download files and read them\ndata_path <- here(\"data\", \"pgwl\")\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# download data\nf_wcr_download(data_path, urls = urls)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# import, clean, and model\nd <-\n  # import downloaded data\n  f_wcr_import(\n    county   = \"Sacramento\",\n    files_in = list.files(data_path, full.names = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  # minor cleaning of one unreasonable value\n  filter(WSE >-200) %>%\n  # clean data\n  f_wcr_clean(start_date = lubridate::ymd(\"2000-01-01\")) %>%\n  # fit a linear model for each SITE_CODE group, extract beta_1\n  f_wcr_model()\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# visualize big picture map\n# create output directory if it doesn't already exist\npath_plot <- here(\"results\", \"plot\")\ndir.create(path_plot)\n\np <- f_wcr_visualize_map(d, yr_min = 5)\nggsave(file.path(path_plot, \"00_ALL.png\"), p, height = 6, width = 6)\n\n# write all timeseries plots. use map instead of walk because we want\n# to capture output to inspect\nsafely_viz <- safely(f_wcr_visualize_timeseries)\nerrs <- group_split(d, SITE_CODE) %>% map(~safely_viz(.x, path_plot))\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# write\n# create output directory if it doesn't already exist\npath_csv <- here(\"results\", \"csv\")\ndir.create(path_csv)\n\n# write all results as one big csv and use default ordering to sort\nwrite_csv(d, file.path(path_csv, \"00_ALL.csv\"))\n\n# silently write a separate csv for each group\nd %>%\n  split(.$SITE_CODE) %>%\n  walk(~write_csv(.x, file.path(path_csv, glue::glue(\"{.x$SITE_CODE[1]}.csv\"))))\n\n\n\nNotice the use of purrr::safely() when calling the f_wcr_visualize_timeseries() function. Sometimes, when mapping over many inputs (for instance 420 SITE_CODEs), we may encounter an error in one of the elements that stops the function from completing. safely() always succeeds, and we can go back and inspect errors because the function returns a list of results and errors (if they occur).\n\nAnother related error-handling verb is possibly() which works like safely, but allows us to specify a default value to insert for each error.\nIn this pipeline, we actually see some errors when we have a SITE_CODE with only one measurement. We can’t create a geom_smooth() ggplot layer with only one point, so it throws an error. But assuming we didn’t know that, we could figure it out by inspecting the output of the safely() function:\n\n\nerrs %>% \n  transpose() %>% \n  simplify_all() %>% \n  unlist()\n\n\n\n$error.message\n[1] \"'gpar' element 'fontsize' must not be length 0\"\n\n$error.call\ncheck.length(gparname)\nWe can browse errs to find the indices of these locations, or find them with code:\n\n\ni <- which(map_lgl(simplify_all(errs), ~!is.null(.x)) == TRUE)\ni\n\n\n\n[1]  54 119\nIf we inspect these indices, we can verify that they only have one measurement each. By using safely(), we were able to not let these 2 elements stall the entire pipeline of 420 elements.\n\n\ngroup_split(d, SITE_CODE)[i]\n\n\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 1 x 8\n  SITE_CODE          MSMT_DATE             WSE WELL_DEPTH\n  <chr>              <dttm>              <dbl>      <int>\n1 383434N1214367W001 2000-04-24 00:00:00 -41.4        160\n# … with 4 more variables: geometry <POINT [°]>, b1 <dbl>,\n#   direction <chr>, length_yr <dbl>\n\n[[2]]\n# A tibble: 1 x 8\n  SITE_CODE          MSMT_DATE             WSE WELL_DEPTH\n  <chr>              <dttm>              <dbl>      <int>\n1 385312N1215006W001 2001-05-29 00:00:00  1.13         75\n# … with 4 more variables: geometry <POINT [°]>, b1 <dbl>,\n#   direction <chr>, length_yr <dbl>\nTo conclude, we abstracted our tasks to a set of functions, each contained in multiple, short, modular scripts rather than one massive and unwieldy script. This helps with maintenance, portability, and reproducibility. We used functional programming to replace for loops, and demonstrated how use safely() for error handling, as errors are a part of life when working with large lists, making requests from APIs or fileservers, and scaling processes to a large number of inputs.\n\n\nPause and think\nImagine you wanted to scale this analysis beyond Sacramento county to Placer County. How would you approach this?\nHow could you scale to all counties in California?\nWhat would you need to scale to all counties in the United States?\n\nClick for Answers!\n\nAs with all things in coding, there are many ways to accomplish this, but some ways are more efficient than others.\nNotice that f_wcr_import() has an argument county. To scale the analysis to Placer county, we would simply change the county argument to \"Placer\". However, you may notice that f_wcr_visualize_map() and f_wcr_visualize_timeseries() both depend on a Sacramento county polygon, so you can swap that out with a Placer county polygon and be off to the races.\nHowever, if you wanted to scale this to the state, you’d need to assemble polygons for all counties in the state. That sounds time consuming. However, as with most things, it’s good practice to google what feels like a common problem, because chances are you’re not the first person with this problem! In fact, there’s a great way to grab county data from directly within R using the {maps} package.\n\n\nlibrary(maps)\ncounties <- st_as_sf(map(\"county\", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))\ncounties <- subset(counties, grepl(\"california\", counties$ID))\nplot(counties)\n\n\n\n\nWith all California counties in hand, we can re-write the function to filter this polygon to the county of interest.\nGoing one step further, if we had a dataset of groundwater levels across the entire US, {maps} has county polygons for each county, so it wouldn’t be difficult to extend our code to a nationwide analysis.\n\n\nTask scheduling\nLet’s imagine that these groundwater levels were not the DWR periodic groundwater level database, but rather a set of continuous monitoring sensors on telemetry that updated daily, and you needed to kick this pipeline off every day at 10am. Surely you wouldn’t manually run 00_control.R every morning. You’d use a task scheduler.\nTask schedulers vary by system. In general, they run a program at defined intervals. We won’t set one up in this course, but it’s good to know about them:\nHow to set up a task scheduler on Windows\nHow to set up cron, an open source task scheduler for Linux\n\nAlso check out the {taskscheduleR} and {cronR} packages for Windows and Linux, which have RStudio add-ins.\nLogging\nWhenever code is running without your supervision on a task scheduler, things may break so it’s a good idea to print information whenever the job kicks off so you can review this information in case something doesn’t go as planned. We’ve been decorating our code with cat() statements that print updates to the console, and this is helpful, but we can be much more sophisticated and start logging. Logging is cornerstone in software engineering, but less so in data science. Logging is important for larger jobs that run often (e.g., anything on a task scheduler) with potential to break, or that may be subject to inputs that sufficiently change and that may breaks code.\nA full discussion of logging is out of scope for this lesson, but you can learn more about logging by browsing these packages:\n{lgr}\n{logger}\n\nWhen to not automate\nAs a data scientist, you’ll often perform once-over ad-hoc analyses. You may or may not need to return to these analyses, or components of the analyses. Automation takes time, and just because we have the tools to automate doesn’t mean that you always should. Whether or not you should automate depends on how often you anticipate the workflow needs to be re-evaluated. The more the workflow needs to be run, the more time we can justify spending on firming up the reproducibility and automation potential of program. When it’s not immediately apparent that automation is necessary (e.g., “a daily report of streamflow automatically scraped from 1,000 sensors that we set up on a task scheduler”) a general rule of thumb for whether or not to automate may boil down to the following consideration:\n\nWill the time saved in the future by automation exceed the time spent automating the process now? If so, automate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure credit: xkcd, 1205\n\n\n\nDon’t underestimate the time it can take to automate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figure credit: xkcd, 1319\n\n\n\n\nCode as instructions\nWe’ve all done a point-and-click analysis before that becomes unwieldy, large, and “too big to fail.” In other words, we cross our fingers and hope we’ll never have to repeat the analysis because either:\nit took so long to complete that it would be unimaginable to spend that same amount of time repeating it\ncertain parts of the workflow were subjective, so repeating it would yield a different result\nrepeating one part of the workflow would invalidate downstream components and derivative products of the workflow, creating even more work\nWriting code is all about ensuring reproducibility and automation so we never find ourselves in this position. Writing efficient code ensures that the code is easy to interact with, debug, and modify.\n\ncode = instructions\n\nNo matter the language the code is in, whether it’s R, Python, Julia or something else, at its most fundamental level, code is a set of instructions to execute. In the data science world, coding allows automation of routine point-and-click tasks, and a good program (e.g., .R script) will replace the need to click through an analysis. Moreover, as data volume (size) and frequency (timing) increase, many point-and-click software tools are stretched to their limits and become slow or non-responsive. Code usually runs without the overhead of graphics processors, can be used again and again, and can be automated to run on its own.\nAs you grow in your capability with R, you will naturally find yourself able to interact with other languages and systems because at the end of the day, you’re in the business of writing instructions for computers to carry out, and these instructions usually involve similar tasks.\n\nAdditional resources\nConvert your R code into command line tools: RStudio is a great interactive development environment (IDE) for writing R code, but it’s important to remember that R is essentially a program on your computer that you can access and interact with via the command line using the utility Rscript. If you need to scale your work to a cluster, or your work expands to involve other programmers who may be less familiar with R, you may need to package your R code as a command line tool, which is a familiar format for data engineers, data scientists, and developers coming from other backgrounds. A command line tool is essentially a program that can be called from the command line, and passed arguments like so:\n\nRscript my_script.R arg1 arg2 arg3\n\nLearn more about turning your R code into a command line tool in this Software Carpentry lesson.\n\n\nPrevious module:Iteration Next module:Parameterized reports\n\nAs discussed in the project management module, abstracting functions from code is a best practice of defining functions and storing them in separate scripts to keep your workspace easier to read and de-bug.↩︎\nNote that over time, the URLS in this code may change, and the data will certainly grow in volume.

It is designed primarily with data scientists in mind, and to that end, you can create pretty complicated Shiny apps with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.\n\nShiny Apps are made using the {shiny} package.\nBecause they extend R-based analyses, interactive Shiny Apps have as many diverse niches and uses as the the R community itself, and it’s likely that you have come across a Shiny App in the wild before.\nShiny Apps are highly customizable, and allow R users to wrap existing code and data with an additional layer of interactivity using R code from the {shiny} package to better visualize, analyze, export, and more. This allows any user (even non-R users!) to interact with the data, providing a powerful way of exploring and understanding the data within the Shiny App.\nNow that we know what a Shiny App is, a fundamental question that we need to answer is “when and why should I build a Shiny App?” Generally, you should create a Shiny App when you want to make results and/or data available to others, or when the dataset is complex enough to warrant a Shiny App to ease exploration. To provide a specific example, let’s examine a case study.\nCase Study: Sacramento county groundwater elevation\nImagine you’re analyzing groundwater levels across California1 and want to assess groundwater elevation trends over time in Sacramento County. You may begin with an EDA to filter the data to Sacramento County, clean the data, and make some exploratory plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# read groundwater level data pre-filtered to Sacramento county\ngwl <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"gwl_sac.csv\")) %>% \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"LONGITUDE\",\"LATITUDE\"), crs = 4269)\n\n# read sacramento county shapefile and reproject\nsac <- st_read(here(\"data\", \"shp\", \"sac\", \"sac_county.shp\"), quiet=TRUE) %>% \n  st_transform(4269)\n\n# plot the groundwater levels at each monitoring site \ngwl %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE, group = SITE_CODE), alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n# slice the first station per group of groundwater level observations\n# (see comment aside)\ngwl_min <- gwl %>% \n  group_by(SITE_CODE) %>% \n  slice(1) %>% \n  ungroup() \n\n# visualize sites on a map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = sac) +\n  geom_sf(data = gwl_min, alpha = 0.5, color = \"blue\") +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nNotice that nrow(gwl) is greater than nrow(gwl_min), but length(unique(gwl$SITE_CODE)) equals length(unique(gwl_min$SITE_CODE)). We don’t need to plot all of the redundant gwl locations on the map, so we created a minimal tibble with only the unique SITE_CODEs, and hence, geometry.\nDuring the analysis, you realize you want to easily look at data by monitoring site, so you make a function that streamlines this.\n\n\n# function that takes a site code and generates a plot\nf_make_hydrograph <- function(data, site_code){\n  p <- data %>% \n    filter(SITE_CODE == site_code) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE)) +\n    geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(title = glue::glue(\"Groundwater level (ft AMSL) at: {site_code}\"))\n  return(p)\n}\n\n# make a hydrograph for the first SITE_CODE\nf_make_hydrograph(gwl, gwl$SITE_CODE[1])\n\n\n\n\nYour supervisor requests figures from certain stations, and you find yourself re-running this function to generate them. You also have teammates that require subsets of these data per monitoring site, with specific columns in the output. You add a function that writes data to csv files to handle this task, but realize that this project is ongoing, and people will keep coming to you with requests for alternate combinations of plots or data. Also, the groundwater level data is sufficiently large and complex that you want to be able to view them all in one place.\n\nOne solution to automate the “data visualization exploration” and “data sharing” processes is to create a Shiny App.\n\nIn the sections that follow, we will create a Shiny App that allows users to easily select and visualize groundwater data at different monitoring stations, and export data for a selected site.\n\nBasic Shiny App Structure\nAt the bare minimum, a Shiny App is an .R file or set of .R files with three components: a ui, server and runApp(). The runApp() function takes the ui and the server objects and runs the Shiny web application.\nBy design, Shiny Apps separate front and back end components of the web application. The ui stands for “user interface” and defines front-facing components that the user sees and interacts with, like plots, tables, sliders, buttons, and so on. The server holds the back-end logic that accepts input from the user, and uses these inputs to define what data transformations should occur and what is passed back to the frontend for the user to view and interact with.\nIn order to demonstrate a simple Shiny App, we will use a single file called app.R defines a ui and server. Afterward, we will also discuss approaches to modularize an app into separate files - this may be necessary if an app becomes sufficiently complex.\nCreating a Shiny App\nThe most simple way to create an app within RStudio is to click File > New File > Shiny Web App….\n\n\n\nBy default, RStudio will create a new folder with a name you provide in your project directory2. Enter gwl_shiny as the “Application name” and click Create.\n\n\n\nYou should now have a folder called gwl_shiny in the project directory, which you can verify in the File Viewer Pane. Inside that folder should be a single file, app.R.\n\n\n\nA default Shiny App is contained in this file. We can run all of the code to view the app on our local machine, or click the Run App icon in the top right corner of the code editor.\n\n\n\nScroll through app.R and notice that there is a ui object, a server object which is a function of input and output, and a runApp() function which takes the ui and server objects as input.\n\nui (frontend)\nThe ui defines what the user sees when they interact with the Shiny App. Generally speaking, the ui shows:\ncontrol widgets (the interface) which allow the user to send commands to the server\noutput from the server\nControl widgets\nConsider the following example App, which demonstrates a few of the control widget3 inputs available for Shiny Apps.\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n    # sidebar with generic example inputs\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            sliderInput(\n              \"i_slider\",     # control widget ID     \n              \"Slider Input\", # label above the widget\n              min = 1,\n              max = 50,\n              value = 30\n            ),\n            fileInput(\n              \"i_file\",       # control widget ID     \n              \"File Input\"    # label above the widget\n            ),\n            dateInput(\n              \"i_date\",       # control widget ID     \n              \"Date Input\"    # label above the widget\n            ),\n            textInput(\n              \"i_text\",       # control widget ID     \n              \"Text Input\"    # label above the widget\n            ),\n            selectInput(\n              \"i_select\",     # control widget ID     \n              \"Select Input\", # label above the widget\n              choices = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")\n            ),\n            radioButtons( \n              \"i_radio\",      # control widget ID  \n              \"Radio Buttons\",# label above the widget\n              choices = c(\"A\",\"B\")\n            )\n        ),\n        mainPanel(\"Look at all those inputs!\")\n    )\n)\n\n# blank server logic - the App does nothing with \n# control widget inputs and creates no output!\nserver <- function(input, output) {}\n\n# run the Shiny app\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese control widgets may be intuitive to you, as we’ve all interacted with web-based tools and apps that use widgets like these. View a more comprehensive list of control widgets here.\nChances are that you won’t use all of the control widget inputs available in any given Shiny App you build. The choice of inputs you use will depend on what information you want to present to the user, and how information they select with those widgets should modify data in the server.\nOutputs\nA ui with only control widgets (i.e., the App example above) is like having a keyboard without a monitor. You can change inputs by typing on the keyboard, but can’t see anything happen without a monitor! In this analogy, the monitor is a set of outputs. Your Shiny App users will spend a lot of time interacting with outputs, and most of our time spent designing and creating a Shiny App will go into creating outputs. To view default Shiny outputs, type shiny::output and see what comes up in tab complete. For example, plotOutput() is used to render plots, textOutput() is used to render text, and so on.\n\n\n\nThere are other types of output not included in the {shiny} package for objects created by other packages, for example leaflet::leafletOutput() and DT::dataTableOutput() create leaflet and DT objects.\nEach output in the ui takes as a first argument the “output id” as a character string, for example, plotOutput(\"my_plot\") means a plotOutput() with an “output id” of \"my_plot\".\n\n\nFix the App\n\nEvery output in the ui should have a corresponding object rendered in the server. Thus, if we define a Shiny App with plotOutput(\"my_plot\") in the ui, we need to assign a rendered plot to the object output$my_plot in the server. For practice, fix the following Shiny App. You’ll know you were successful if you see a plot when running the App.\n\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# user interface\nui <- fluidPage( plotOutput(\"plot\") )\n\n# server logic that draws a plot\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  output$my_plot <- renderPlot({ plot(1:10) })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\nClick for the Answer!\n\nThis very boring Shiny App illustrates a very critical concept. It has no control widget inputs, but it does have a matching output id and output object in the ui and server respectively.\nThe answer, therefore, is frustratingly simple: plotOutput(\"plot\") should be plotOutput(\"my_plot\").\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# user interface\nui <- fluidPage( plotOutput(\"my_plot\") )\n\n# server logic that draws a plot\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  output$my_plot <- renderPlot({ plot(1:10) })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserver (backend)\nIf the ui control widgets are like the keyboard receiving inputs, then the server is the computer brain of the Shiny App that takes inputs, translates the information from the inputs (code that does something with the data input), and creates outputs, and finally sends these back to the ui where a user can interact or see the result.\nReactivity\nReactivity4 is a driving concept in Shiny App programming. The fundamental idea is that what happens in a Shiny App depends only on values that change, and parts of the App are interconnected such that when inputs change, these inputs trigger a re-evaluation of code that regenerates outputs, until the inputs change again, and so on.\nRender objects\nIn the ui we saw that each output ID created by the server had a unique ID name and was wrapped in an “output” function. For example, plotOutput(\"my_plot\") had an object in the server called output$my_plot that was assigned the result of a renderPlot({ }) function, and inside that function was the code for our plot. Each “render” function has a corresponding “output” function (e.g., renderText() and textOutput() go together). To view some of the default “render” functions, type shiny::render and view the options available in the tab complete popup.\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\nLet’s take what we’ve covered and put it all together to address the Case Study introduced above. We will build a simple Shiny App with a plotOutput() and DT::dataTableOutput() that shows the hydrograph and data for a user-specified monitoring point. We’ll also include data download buttons within the data table and demonstrate how to make the plot interactive with {plotly}.\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shinythemes)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load sac county groundwater data and sac county polygon\ngwl <- read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"gwl\", \"gwl_sac_shiny.csv\"))\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# user interface\nui <- fluidPage(\n\n    # change default theme to \"united\"\n    theme = shinytheme(\"united\"),\n  \n    # application title\n    titlePanel(\"Sacramento County Groundwater Level Data\"),\n\n    # sidebar with a dropdown input for site_code\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            selectInput(\"site_code\",\n                        \"Select a site code:\",\n                        choices = unique(gwl$SITE_CODE))\n        ),\n\n        # tabs with hydrograph and data table\n        mainPanel(\n            tabsetPanel(\n                tabPanel(\"Hydrograph\", plotly::plotlyOutput(\"gwl_plot\")),\n                tabPanel(\"Data\", DT::dataTableOutput(\"gwl_data\"))\n            )\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# define server logic to plot a hydrograph and create data table\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n\n    # --------------------------------------------------\n    # create hydrograph\n    output$gwl_plot <- plotly::renderPlotly({\n\n        # draw the ggplot based on the \"site_code\" user input\n        p <- filter(gwl, SITE_CODE == input$site_code) %>%\n            ggplot(aes(MSMT_DATE, WSE)) +\n            geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +\n            geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n            labs(title = input$site_code,\n                 x = \"\", y = \"Groundwater level (ft AMSL)\")\n\n        # render the plotly object\n        plotly::ggplotly(p)\n    })\n\n    # --------------------------------------------------\n    # create data table\n    output$gwl_data <- DT::renderDataTable({\n\n        # draw the plot based on the \"site_code\" user input\n        DT::datatable(\n            filter(gwl, SITE_CODE == input$site_code),\n            extensions = 'Buttons',\n            options =\n                list(dom = 'Bfrtip',\n                     buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print'))\n        )\n    })\n}\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\nThe sidebarLayout() and tabsetPanel() functions demonstrated in this module are just a few of the many layout options to configure the placement of control widgets and outputs in your Shiny Apps.\nShiny App design and customization options are vast. We demonstrated the “united” theme here, which is one of many {shinythemes}. You can also add custom CSS in-line, or in a styles.css script in the Shiny App directory.\nFinally, although we demonstrate a simple Shiny App, more functional and complex Apps may benefit from modularizing particular App components. Learn more about building Shiny modules here.\n\nLet’s break down what we just did.\nBefore anything else, we loaded the packages we needed5 and our groundwater level data gwl.\nNext, in the ui, we added a custom theme from the {shinythemes} package to change the default appearance of our App. We used a selectInput() control widget with a ID \"site_code\" and choices equal to the unique values of SITE_CODEs in the gwl dataframe. Then, in the mainPanel() we added a tabsetPanel() with two tabPanel() tabs: one with a plotly::plotlyOutput() plot, and another with a DT::dataTableOutput() output.\nFinally, in the server, we rendered plotly and dataTable objects and saved them to the output object under the output IDs \"gwl_plot\" and \"gwl_data\". These objects are displayed in the ui.\nAnd the resulting Shiny App is:\n\n\n\n\n\nShare and deploy a Shiny App\nUp until now, we’ve been using our own computer to run our Shiny App example. How do we share a Shiny App with others?\nThe fastest and simplest way to share your Shiny app with another R user is to share the app.R file and data dependencies. They can open the file and run the app on their computer as we’ve been doing in this module. However, we may want to share our app with a wider, non-technical audience over the internet. When we move a Shiny App from our computer onto a web server so that it can be shared over the internet, we deploy the app.\nThere are a range of services that allow us to deploy Shiny Apps that range from simple to complex, and costly to inexpensive.\nA relatively painless way to deploy is via shinyapps.io, run by RStudio. A free tier is available, and provides a limited number of “live hours” per month for users to interact with your App. Paid tiers afford more “live hours” per month, a faster web server, and features like password protection.\n{shiny} is open source, and in that spirit, the open source Shiny Server can be installed on any local or cloud server (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). If you don’t have a background in cloud computing, your System Administrator (Sys Admin) can help you move your App onto a cloud or company server6. Although this option requires more manual setup than shinyapps.io, it offers a non-commercial alternative, and perhaps more control depending on your needs.\n\nExtending Shiny\nCongratulations! You’re now familiar with the basics of {shiny}. This module is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many ways to extend {shiny}, and the opportunities for customization of Shiny Apps are vast. We recommend the following ways to increase your knowledge in this domain:\nfind open source Shiny Apps that you admire, clone their source code to your machine, run the App, and change things so you can explore how the App works. Borrow bits of code in new Apps you create\nfind a side project that’s a good candidate for a Shiny App and build one - it doesn’t need to be work-related; in fact, it might be more fun to work on something tangential that you find interesting\nexplore the free online books and guided video tutorials in the links below\nAdditional Resources\nBelow are a few freely available books, presentations, and locations to find Apps online:\nMastering Shiny: Free online book that serves as an authoritative guide on how to build, maintain, deploy, and customize R Shiny Apps. Material goes well beyond what is presented in this module.\nGuided Shiny Video tutorials: Series of guided video tutorials with live-code demos and slides that explain the fundamentals of R Shiny Apps and how to use them.\nRStudio Shiny Gallery: Examples of Shiny Apps highlighting different ways Shiny has been used, with links to source code\n\n\nPrevious module:4.

Different widgets allow different types of information to pass between the ui and server. Notice that the first argument to each control widget is the unique ID or name of that widget. IDs must be unique, and are accessed in the server in a named list called input. For example, the sliderInput(\"bins\") has the unique ID \"i_slider\" and the user-input value to this widget can be accessed from within the server with input$i_slider.↩︎\nA comprehensive treatment of reactive programming in Shiny is beyond the scope of this module, but we recommend reading this article, and this book section to learn more about reactive graphs when you decide to start building more complex Shiny Apps.↩︎\nAlthough we don’t cover it in this module, you can also split your App into 3 files: ui.R (for the ui), server.R (for the server), and global.R (loads all App dependencies). When an App becomes big and complex, splitting it up into smaller parts can make it easier to develop.↩︎\nThe Shiny Server Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/)) provides detailed documentation geared towards System Administrators that will help in deploying a Shiny App.↩︎\n",

In R, major versions are released infrequently (i.e., 3.0.0 was released in April 2013 and 4.0.0 was released in April 2020), but minor versions are released more regularly (4.0.4 was released in February 2021 and 4.0.5 was released in March 2021).\nAt minimum it’s advisable to maintain and update to the most recent major version of R, as these often contain important security/programming changes. Depending on your workflow and package needs, it’s good practice to keep the most recent minor version as well, though it’s not uncommon to maintain multiple minor versions of R if your analyses or workflows depend on specific versions of a package.\nCheck your    Version\nAn easy and quick way to check what version of R you have and the most recent available version is first to open R, type R.version, hit enter, and see what you get:\n\n\nR.version\n\n\n               _                           \nplatform       aarch64-apple-darwin20      \narch           aarch64                     \nos             darwin20                    \nsystem         aarch64, darwin20           \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          1.0                         \nyear           2021                        \nmonth          05                          \nday            18                          \nsvn rev        80317                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18)\nnickname       Camp Pontanezen             \n\nThis command will return information about the R version your system is using, as well as some information specific to your operating system (os).\nNext, visit the R CRAN website to see what the most recent version is. If you haven’t updated recently, go ahead and grab the most recent R version for your system and install it.\nWhen you update a major version of R, your personal library of packages will no longer work, and you will need to reinstall all of your packages. There are a few tools you can use to do this like {installr} for Windows machines, and {updateR}. This work to stay up-to-date happens fairly infrequently.\nCheck/Update  \nWe can check our version of RStudio by going to the toolbar at the top of your RStudio window and clicking Help > Check for Updates. If you have the most recent version, there will be a message box letting you know as much. If not, RStudio will direct you to their webpage to download the most recent version.\nWhile it isn’t always necessary to update to the most recent version of R, there’s no reason not to always use the most recent stable version of RStudio. It will generally include the best features and up-to-date fixes.\nUpdating R Packages\nAs we use R more regularly for different tasks, it’s common to accumulate many R packages in our R library. Every package is maintained and updated on a different schedule than R and RStudio, and so as new functions and features are written, or bugs are fixed, packages will be updated intermittently. Some package maintainers do this regularly, others may do it sporadically. Either way, we will typically need to update packages semi-regularly.\nFiles associated with installed R packages are located at .libPaths(). View installed packages with list.files(.libPaths()).\nThere are several methods of updating your R packages. If updating via RStudio, go to the toolbar at the top and select Tools > Check for Package Updates.... Depending on how many packages you’ve installed, and how recently you updated things, a window will appear saying either All packages up-to-date! or something that looks more like this:\nAs a rule of thumb, whenever updating your R version, it’s best to update/install your R packages too!\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Package update window\n\n\n\nWe can choose to Select All and update everything at once, or selectively update things.\nAfter we click Install Updates we may typically also see a message like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Restart R\n\n\n\nYou can choose to cancel, but it’s fine to click Yes and proceed. Sometimes we will also get something in the Console that will ask the following:\n\nDo you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)\n\nSome packages require this, so generally it’s okay to type Yes and hit enter to proceed. At this point we can wait and let R/RStudio update things for us. Depending on how many packages are involved, this can take a few minutes. Importantly, when it’s all said and done, make sure there weren’t errors or issues with packages that didn’t get installed. We can use Tools > Check for Package Updates... again and see what packages remain, or if we get a message saying all packages are up-to-date.\nBest Practices for Updating\nWe recommend the following approach to updating R packages (check out the great rstats.wtf chapter on this topic and more):\nUpdate packages frequently (weekly)\nUpdate R quarterly (or at least check)\nFor complete reproducibility for a project check out the {renv} package\nDon’t copy packages over between R versions–start clean and fresh\nUpdating packages can be irksome, but it’s typically for the best. We advise updating your packages frequently if you regularly use R (e.g;, a weekly checks and updates to packages). If you want to be sure you have the exact package version for future use and reproducibility, the {renv} may be a great solution for an analysis or report, but may not be necessary if your aren’t using or working on a specific project/analysis. {renv} keeps a record of your R packages within an RProject down to the exact version number when you originally loaded these packages, and allows you to update this record as your project evolves over time.\nRead more about {renv} in the project management module.\nOverall, treat R and R packages as something that will be highly functional with minimal but regular maintenance, like a vehicle that needs new tires or an oil change once in a while. This will keep things running smoothly over the long-term.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Success over time! (Artwork by @allison_horst)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious module: Introduction Next module: 2.

Version control is a framework and process to keep track of changes made to a document, data, or code with the added bonus that you can revert to any previous change or point in time and you can work in parallel with multiple people on the same material. In this module, we will practice version control with git, which is perhaps the most common version control system available today.\nThe important difference between using a tool like git and Github versus cloud-based services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Docs) which are in a way, version control systems, is the ability to control exactly what changes and/or files get “versioned”. These versions are snapshots of your work with unique identifiers along with a short commit message, which allows us to restore these changes at any point in time. Thus, git offers much finer control over specific changes by specific users; this makes version control a very powerful tool (as well as a computer lifesaver when things go awry!).\nWhat is the difference between git and Github?\ngit is a version control program that is installed on your computer with associated commands we use to interact with version controlled files.\nGithub is a website that interfaces with git and allows us to store/access/share our files as repositories1.\nThere is a rich and complex set of tools and functionality with git and Github, but in this module, we’ll focus on the basics and link to more material.\nUsing version control\nSome folks may just use version control as another way to backup their work2, but version control really shines when working on a collaborative project. For example, many are familiar with the situation below:\nFigure from http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif\nThe comic above shows a single thesis document, but really the situation isn’t any different than a big data analysis project. A common series of steps that are generally taken by multiple people, may include:\nDownload/gather data\nClean/transform data\nAnalyze and visualize data\nProduce a front facing product or report\nMany of these tasks (or subtasks) may overlap or depends on one another. Complex collaborative projects require forethought in how to set things up so everyone can seamlessly stitch their contribution into the overall fabric of a project without holding up the process for other team members.\nWith version control, if changes you make break things, it’s easy to revert or get back to an earlier working version using the commit timeline, because we have access to the history of our changes.\n\nPause and Discuss!\n\nIf you had 10 people to work on a big project with steps outlined above, how would you approach it? How would you break out these pieces or subtasks? How would you track progress?\n\n\n\nThis module will cover version control with git, including the basic commands, but it’s important to remember:\n\nUnderstanding and learning how to approach, setup, and implement collaborative projects with version control are just as important as learning git commands\n\nThus, successful version control is not just about effectively using tools like git, but also developing skills to organize projects, collaborate with others, and implement version control so it’s useful (not just another way to back things up…see below).\nLearn to leverage the power of git for things other than just a backup! (Figure from https://xkcd.com/1597/)\n\n\n\nLearning git through a project\nSometimes the best way to learn is to walk through a real-world example. Let’s walk through a simplified example of a common set of tasks a team may face using R and learning git along the way.\nLet’s imagine we have a team, Jo and Mo. Each has a unique skill set, and each knows how to use R and git. The team is tasked with downloading and visualizing flow data for a specific river gage to provide status report updates on a monthly basis, which are used for various regulatory actions (i.e., how much water is available for diversion, how flows relate to period of record averages, etc). In this case, the cloud is Github where our main repository lives. More on this in a moment. First we need to make sure everything is setup and installed before we begin our git project!\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example team and workflow.\n\n\n\nSetup git locally\nWe highly recommend Jenny Bryan & Jim Hester’s happygitwithr website because it covers everything (and more) that you may encounter when using git with R. In particular, please take a moment to check/update your git installation and configure Github. The following links will help with this:\nInstall Git\nIntroduce yourself to Git\nThe {usethis} package is an excellent option to help you get things setup within R, like this:\n\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\n# use your actual git user name and email!\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"yoda\", user.email = \"yoda2021@example.org\")\n\n\n\nRemember, we only need to do this once!3\nCreate a Repository\nThere are several ways to create repositories on Github and with RStudio4. We recommend the Github first option as it’s easiest to intialize and manage.\nTo begin, go to Github.com and login. From there, let’s create a new repository!\n\nChallenge\n\nPlease take a moment and create a new repository on Github following the happygitwithr.com instructions.\nName the repository water-is-life\nCheck the Add a README file box at the bottom\nMake this a public repository\n\nClick for Answers!\n\nHopefully you see something like this before you click the green Create Repository button.\n\n\n\nAnd then afterwards, a screen like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe last piece to this is getting this repository which is currently in the “cloud” to a local copy on your computer. This is called cloning. To clone the repository to your computer, we need to do the following:\nCopy the repository address. Make sure you’ve clicked HTTPS and the link in the box starts with https://. Copy that link to your clipboard.\n\n\n\nNow open RStudio and navigate to File > New Project > Version Control > Git\nIn the Repository URL box, paste the link in, and hit Tab. The Project directory Name should automagically fill with the name of the repository. Go ahead and put this where you want it to live locally5 and hit Create Project. Open in new session is optional, but allows you to keep existing projects open.\n\n\n\nGreat! We should now have an RStudio project that is version controlled with git, and there is a local copy we can work with on our computer.\nCollaborative Github Settings\nSince we are working on a collaborative project, we need to make sure our collaborators have access to make changes to our repository. So, if Jo created the repository, they would need to add fellow collaborators to the repository. Let’s do that now:\nGo to Github.com and login\nNavigate to your repository water-is-life\nClick on the Settings tab in the upper right corner\nYou can view and clone (copy) any public Github repository. However, you can only commit changes if you are the owner, or have been added as a collaborator (more on this later).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Click on the Settings tab in the upper right corner to add collaborators.\n\n\n\nClick on Manage Access on the side bar on the left (you may need to enter your password or authentication again)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Then click on Manage Access.\n\n\n\nClick on Invite Collaborator and enter the username or email you want to add!\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Invite collaborators by email or username!\n\n\n\nBranches & Conflicts\nOften when teaching git, we start with the basic commands. However, it’s important to consider one of the more powerful parts of using git is the ability to use branches. Branches, or branching, in git, is a way for multiple folks to work on the same repository independently, and a standardized way to integrate those changes back into the repository. Every repository typically starts with one single main branch. This is like the trunk of the tree, or the main train track. We can create additional branches off of this track, and if we want to merge them back in to make them available for our collaborators, we use something called a pull request. This is essentially a way to double check if there will be any conflicts between the work in the branch and the work in the main branch6, and it also provides a way to document and review any changes. If a pull request does not create merge conflicts (don’t worry about this now, we will cover it later) and if a collaborator on the repository approves the pull request, then the branch is “pulled” (or merged) into the main branch, and then typically deleted (since the branch has served its purpose, and the changes in it are now reflected in the main branch).\nEven if you are the only person working in a repo, it’s a good habit to use branches because if you realize the branch/work you are doing is a dead end, you can always delete a branch and return to the main branch to pick things up where you last left off.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of multiple branches in a project splitting off the main branch\n\n\n\nCreate a branch\nIn our example we want to make sure we keep our main branch clean and up-to-date with changes we are happy with…all other work will go through a branch, pull request, review, and merge process to minimize conflicts or duplication of work.\nJo is a wizard at grabbing the data we want to work with and saving it in an organized way. She’s cloned the repository to her computer, and the first thing she wants to do is create a fresh branch to work off of, so her changes can be reviewed before being merged into the main branch.\nWe can create a branch in RStudio in one of two ways:\nTools > Terminal > New Terminal and look for the Terminal tab in RStudio. Click on it, and at the prompt, type:  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME.\nUsing the Git tab in RStudio and clicking on the New Branch button, type in the branch name, make sure the Remote is set to origin and click Create!\nLet’s create a new branch called jo_download_data. Ideally, each team member will do the same, and each of these branches comes from the main branch, which is the main trunk or “clean” version of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Jo creates a new branch from main to write a data download script in R.\n\n\n\nDownload Data: add, commit, push\nJo’s task is to download the data. Because this is a task that will need to happen regularly, she writes a function to download the specific river discharge data to an organized set of folders. She runs the function to get the most recent data, and saves it locally on her version of the repository!\nAs she works, the general process she follows is:\nadd: Do some work, add some files, scripts, etc. To version control these changes, we need to stage or add that work so it can be versioned by git. We do this with git add <my_file> or check the Staged buttons in the RStudio git panel.\ncommit: Add a commit message that is succinct but descriptive (i.e., added water data files). These are the messages you’ll be able to go back to if you want to travel back in time and see a different version of something…so be kind to your future self and add something helpful.\npush: Finally, when we’re ready to send locally commited changes up the cloud, we push this up to the Github remote cloud repository!\nRemember, you can commit as frequently as you like, and push at the end of the day, or push every time you commit. The timestamp identifier is added with a commit message, not with the push.\n\nYou Try!\n\nTake the following function and:\nMake a new folder in your project called code, save as a script called 01_download_data.R\nstage it (either through the Git tab, or via git add),\ncommit (add a message!),\npush to the jo_download_data branch\n\n\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(dataRetrieval)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n# make a function to download data, defaults to current date for end\n\n# function: dates as \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\nget_daily_flow <- function(gage_no){\n\n  # create folder to save data\n  fs::dir_create(\"data_raw\")\n\n  # set parameters to download data\n  siteNo <- gage_no # The USGS gage number\n  pCode <- \"00060\" # 00060 is discharge parameter code\n\n  # get NWIS daily data: CURRENT YEAR\n  dat <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = siteNo,\n                    parameterCd = pCode)\n  # add water year\n  dat <- addWaterYear(dat)\n  # rename the columns\n  dat <- renameNWISColumns(dat)\n\n  # save out\n  write_csv(dat,\n            file =\n              glue(\"data_raw/nfa_updated_{Sys.Date()}.csv\"))\n}\n\n# RUN with:\n#siteNo <- \"11427000\"# NF American River\n# get_daily_flow(siteNo)\n\n\n\n\nAnswers!\n\nOnce we’ve made our script and saved it in the code folder, we should see something like this in our Git tab… notice the change when the box is checked.\n\n\n\nNext we want to commit and add a message. Note when we first click the Commit button, we’ll see this screen:\n\n\n\nWhen we enter a commit message and click Commit, we’ll end up with this, which tells us our commit worked…but it’s still only local! Note we’ll have a message saying our branch is\n\nahead of origin/jo_download_data by 1 commit.\n\nThat’s ok, it just means we still need to push our changes up to the remote branch.\n\n\n\nThe final step is to push our changes up to the cloud. Click Push and you should get a message back like this. This means things worked…a final check would be go to Github and make sure the file is online!\n\n\n\n\nThink of every commit you make as a train station. The more commits you make (and the more descriptive they are) the easier it will be to get around…particularly because your train can travel back in time!\nPull Requests\nThe next step in this version control odyssey is to get Jo’s work from the jo_download_data branch into the main branch. Here we use a Pull Request. This is a way to review the changes, check for any conflicts (if for instance, folks were working on the same file), and then Merge these changes into the main branch. Then we can delete the jo_download_data branch, create another one to work on the next task, and so on.\nHere’s what we might see on Github if we visited our water-is-life repository after we pushed our changes up. First, we will hopefully see an option to make a pull request because Github recognizes there are changes from another branch that aren’t in the main branch. We want to click the Compare and pull request button.\n\n\n\nNext we have an option to add some additional descriptions, comments, about what this pull request (PR) is doing, and why. We can tag a reviewer (collaborator on the Github repo), and add labels, milestones, etc. These are all helpful for keeping track of what’s done and what’s not.\n\n\n\nAfter we click the green Create pull request button, we should see something that looks like the following. Important! We ideally will see a green checkmark with a message \"This branch has no conflicts with the base branch, which means, our main branch can easily merge this new work in!\nmerge conflicts are not something to be worried about, they happen, and there are a number of ways to resolve them. A good resource and walk through using Github is here, or with command line here.\n\n\n\nExiting vim: if you end up in a text editor and aren’t sure how to exit, you may be in vim. It is the default editor for many systems and programs. To exit without saving changes, hit Esc, then type :q! and hit Enter. To save changes, hit Esc and then type :wq and hit Enter.\n\nGo ahead and click Merge pull request, and wait until you see a screen shortly after that says the Pull request was successfully merged and closed!\n\n\n\n\nfetch and pull\nNow that Jo has completed the first part of the team task, we want to move to the second task, which is cleaning the data. Thankfully Mo is great at data visualization, and has a script that will clean up the code and visualize it for us. But first, Mo needs to pull the changes that Jo just merged into the main repository. There are two approaches to this. One is to use a git fetch, the other is a git pull. The main difference between the two:\nfetch: The safe version, because it downloads any remote content from the repository, but does not update your local repository state. It just keeps a copy of the remote content, leaving any current work intact. To fully integrate the new content, we need to follow a fetch by a merge.\npull: This downloads the remote content and then immediately merges the content with your local state, but if you have pending work, this will create something called a merge conflict, but not to worry, these can be fixed!7.\nMo needs to pull changes in to his branch from main and proceed with the task. Here we assume Jo has already completed work on her branch to download, clean, and transform the data.\n\n\n\n\nYou Try!\n\nTake the following code from Mo and:\npull changes into the repository so everything is up-to-date!\ncreate a unique branch: mo_cleanviz\nsave this code to a new script at code/02_clean_visualize.R\nstage it (either through the Git tab, or via git add),\ncommit (add a message!),\npush to Mo’s branch\nFinish by adding a Pull Request and merging back to main!\n\nAnswers!\n\nNow we have a commit history that might look something like this.\n\n\n\nWhat is one explanation for commit 4? We also have a project that is very easy to re-run and update, and it can be updated or integrated into a parameterized Rmarkdown report which could be shared and updated easily.\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing the loop\nWe’ve reviewed how to create branches, add and revise files, and then commit and push these changes to a shared repository for collaborative projects. Importantly, it’s best practice to always pull/fetch at the beginning of each work session so you have the most-up-to-date changes. And if something needs to be fixed, you can always pull a specific branch and make a change and pull request for that branch before pull requesting and merging back to the main.\nFor example, if Jo needed to make a quick fix to some data analysis, she could pull Mo’s branch, make a fix (commit 4), and merge that back into the same branch before he finalizes the analysis and merges back to the main branch.\n\n\n\nThis is a simplified workflow, but it is very powerful. There are additional options within this workflow, like reverting to previous versions, pruning branches or git history, and more, but the core steps to successfully using version control rely on the material covered above, and practice!\n\nAdditional Git Details\nAlthough there are many more details important to learning version control, many come with more practice and expertise. However, a few important tidbits:\nWhen working on Github, there are options for private and public repositories. private repos are only visible to you and any collaborators you’ve added to your repo. Certain accounts permit unlimited private repos.\n.gitignore: We can access or create this file with the usethis::edit_git_ignore() function. Any file extension or specific file we include in our .gitignore file will mean git ignores it. This is helpful for hidden files or temporary files that may change a lot (i.e., *.html) but aren’t necessary to version contol. You can even ignore entire directories or large files ( >= 100MB). Github is designed to version control scripts, not large amounts of data.\nAdditionally you can use the usethis::git_vaccinate() function to ensure there are no issues or secure files that may get accidentally added to your version control repository.\nLarge files…Github is great, but less ideal for large files. Github will complain with any file over about ~50MB, and anything greater than 100MB requires git-lfs (large file sizes), but it is still unwieldy. See this article for suggestions and options.\n\nResources & Tutorials\nhttps://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/\nhttps://learngitbranching.js.org\nR for excel with github\n“Excuse me do you have a moment to talk version control?” by Jenny Bryan\nGithub for project management\n\n\nPrevious module: 1. Updating R Next module: 3. Project Management\n\nGithub is not the only site that integrates with git to provide cloud-based version control. Other notable examples include Gitlab and Bitbucket. In this module, we will focus on Github, although the underlying git commands you will learn are extensible to other git-based repositories.↩︎\nGit xkcd↩︎\nIf you ever need to edit your global/git profile, you can use a situation report, usethis::git_sitrep() to see what settings exist and how to diagnose problems.↩︎\nsee this excellent overview of the various ways to create/link an RStudio project with a Github repository↩︎\nIt’s a good idea to store all your github repositories in one place (e.g., ~/Documents/Github). We recommend to avoid nesting git/RStudio projects inside other git/RStudio projects–this can create confusion and make it difficult to properly version control different projects. Each project should have its own repository (e.g., ~/Documents/Github/project_01, ~/Documents/Github/project_02).↩︎\nIn more complex workflows, we can pull branches into other branches before pulling them into the main branch. In the module, we will use more simplified examples, but just remember that there are many other ways to branch and merge.↩︎\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github↩︎\n",
