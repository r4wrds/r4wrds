**Course Objectives**

What we want you to be able to do:

* Use R to import and organize bioassessment data 

* Create plots using R packages to explore basic data trends

* Create maps in R to explore/report spatial patterns 

:::

<br>

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of R. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, as well as provide resources for more foundational learning.

## Workshop Overview

We will be following the [SFS Code of Conduct](https://freshwater-science.org/about/society-governance/code-of-conduct) throughout our workshop.

## Instructors

<br>

* [Ryan Peek](https://ryanpeek.org/) ([rapeek "at" ucdavis "dot" edu](mailto:rapeek@ucdavis.edu)) - Ryan is currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis. His interests focus on integrations of amphibian and fish ecology, genomics, hydrology and hydropower, food web dynamics, and environmental flow management of rivers and streams in California. He is a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) Instructor and co-coordinator for the [Davis R Users' Group](https://d-rug.github.io/).

* [Heili Lowman](https://www.heililowman.com/) ([heilil "at" sccwrp "dot" org](mailto:heilil@sccwrp.org)) - Heili is a Scientist at the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project. Her research projects focus on the biogeochemistry of ecological margins – sediment/water, land/ocean, wildland/urban – and are coupled with a passion for teaching, mentorship, and scientific communication. Heili is the leader of the [SCCWRP Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/hlowman/TidyTuesday) series, a member of [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), and enjoys traveling, cooking, and spending time with her cats.

## Software requirements

Please setup a computer/laptop with the latest version of RStudio and R installed.  Download the compressed [data](https://github.com/ucd-cws/CABW2020_R_training/raw/main/data/datazip.zip) folder and make sure it is accessible on your computer.  The [setup instructions](01_setup_R.html) will guide you through the rest of the process.  Take note of the required R packages that you must also download and install.  Please contact the instructors with any questions or issues related to setup.  

If for whatever reason you can't get RStudio installed with the right packages, we can help you set up a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account which you can use for the workshop.
